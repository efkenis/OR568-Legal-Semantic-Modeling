FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
4. The Veteran did not have a psychiatric disorder in service that was unrelated to the use of drugs.,FindingSentence
5. The preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service or was aggravated during service.,FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION,Sentence
Analysis,Sentence
"After reviewing all of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that was caused or aggravated by his service.",FindingSentence
"In regard to direct service connection, although the Veteran has been diagnosed with depression or major depressive disorder subsequent to service, his most current examination shows that the Veteran either does not have depression or that any current depression is unrelated to the Veteran's military service.",FindingSentence
"While the Veteran claimed that he was depressed and suicidal in service, the Veteran was admitted for inpatient treatment for substance induced psychosis in 1978 and no mention of any depression or suicidal thinking was made at that time or any other time in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, his memories are contradicted by the more reliable contemporaneous evidence.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, no diagnosis of depression was made until 1985, six years after the Veteran's service, and at that time there was also no indication that the Veteran's service had anything to do with his depression.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, even if the Veteran does have depression, this occurred after service and the evidence shows it was not caused by service.",ReasoningSentence
The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements.,Sentence
"In addition, although the statement from J.P.S. indicates that he was aware of the sexual trauma from the karate instructor at the time the Veteran started his active duty, the Veteran has said that he did not tell anyone of this until 1991 or, in the case of his family, until later.",EvidenceSentence
"Further, even though the Veteran enlisted in the USMCR in August 1975, it is his contention that he realized he must leave active duty upon reporting for training in January 1976 to deal with his situation.",EvidenceSentence
The statement of J.P.S. tends to support this view of events by the Veteran.,EvidenceSentence
"However, it strains credulity to accept this information as the Veteran had months before service to change his mind about going on active duty.",ReasoningSentence
"Further, he reported that he had no psychiatric problems at the time of his enlistment physical.",EvidenceSentence
"He also received a meritorious promotion upon completion of basic training, a fact that is in stark contrast with his assertions of not being able to function and wanting to commit suicide during basic training.",ReasoningSentence
No other supporting lay statement has knowledge of the Veteran's actual service.,EvidenceSentence
The statement from G.S. relates to what he knew of the Veteran prior to service.,EvidenceSentence
The same is true of the statement from P.D.,EvidenceSentence
It is clear that both individuals thought highly of the Veteran and that they had positive relationships.,ReasoningSentence
"Neither individual could, or did, address the Veteran's status in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Further, they also are not aware of all of the facts in this matter and their challenges to determinations made or evidence contained in the record have no credibility.",ReasoningSentence
"The Veteran himself has provided the statements, in regard to his sexual activities, drug use and religious practices to his care providers on multiple occasions, particularly in regard to his pre-service drug abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"As stated several times, his mother has confirmed the Veteran's pre-service drug use.",EvidenceSentence
She has also related that she had difficulty in coping with the Veteran and his behavior.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran claims that he also has PTSD that is related to his service.,Sentence
The May 2008 letter from the VA physician does not support the Veteran's claim.,ReasoningSentence
He noted the Veteran was treated in the clinic for PTSD related to the pre-service sexual trauma.,EvidenceSentence
"The physician noted that, as a routine, a check of a veteran's DD 214 is done to review for stressors.",EvidenceSentence
He did not relate any military stressors for this Veteran and his DD 214 would not indicate any as the Veteran was not in combat and has not alleged such service.,ReasoningSentence
The Veteran was examined three times.,EvidenceSentence
"On two of those occasions, the Veteran was found to have PTSD that was related to child abuse and not anything that occurred in the military.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran's treatment records also show a PTSD diagnosis that is related to the pre-service sexual abuse.,EvidenceSentence
"However, sexual abuse in the military could not be corroborated.",EvidenceSentence
The only military stressor that was corroborated was the fact that a Marine who was injured prior to when the Veteran arrived at his duty station later died while hospitalized.,EvidenceSentence
"However, there is no evidence linking any diagnosis of PTSD or any other mental disorder to this event.",EvidenceSentence
"On the third examination in May 2011, the Veteran was specifically evaluated for PTSD and was not found to even have this disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"This conclusion is highly probative insofar as it was made based on a review of the entire claims folder, including documentation of the Veteran's extensive substance abuse and treatment history and after consideration of the opinions of the earlier two VA examiners, who acknowledged that it was hard to diagnose the Veteran because his answers were often vague or off topic.",ReasoningSentence
The third examiner determined that the Veteran did not have any psychiatric diagnosis and that no psychiatric symptoms were aggravated specifically by the Veteran's military service.,EvidenceSentence
"While the two VA examiners who previously examined the Veteran opined that there may have been some minor aggravation of the Veteran's symptoms due to his military service, neither of them explained the mechanism through which this aggravation supposedly occurred or that there was evidence of PTSD in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Notably, there is no credible evidence that any of the in-service events complained of by the Veteran, aside from the death of the recruit, actually occurred.",FindingSentence
"While one recruit who was unknown to the Veteran and injured prior to the Veteran arriving at his duty station died while hospitalized, there is no evidence that an additional four of the Veteran's friends died in service as he claimed.",EvidenceSentence
"There is no credible evidence that the Veteran was physically or sexually assaulted in service; he did not advance these contentions until his appeal was well underway and he never provided any specifics about the supposed assaults, other than to say that he was once invited to another soldier's home, to which he apparently did not go.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, while the Veteran contended that he reported childhood sexual abuse to his commander and was not allowed to go home to cope with it, documentation such as treatment records and even the written statement from the Veteran's mother indicate that the Veteran was unaware of the sexual abuse until long after his military service.",EvidenceSentence
"Also, his outstanding performance, as documented in his personnel records, as well as the letter of recommendation by his company commander and the dining facility officer do not support a conclusion that the Veteran's performance waned upon his graduation from basic training and receipt of a meritorious promotion.",ReasoningSentence
"The three VA examination reports do not support a conclusion that a psychiatric disorder, other than the drug induced one from 1978, was present in service.",ReasoningSentence
The STRs are clearly negative for such evidence.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran denied having any type of a psychiatric disorder, or history thereof, on his enlistment in the Navy in June 1981.",EvidenceSentence
The post-service treatment records do not provide supporting evidence to conclude that a psychiatric condition existed in service that was unrelated to the Veteran's drug abuse.,EvidenceSentence
The evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran had a psychiatric condition in service other than the two drug-related diagnoses from 1978.,FindingSentence
It is clear from the 1978 discharge summary that the Veteran received extensive therapy and treatment over a two month period.,EvidenceSentence
"The diagnoses were not determined without what appears to be a thorough understanding of the Veteran's psychiatric status, at the time of treatment and prior to the period of hospitalization.",EvidenceSentence
The history of drug abuse cited in the summary is supported by numerous admissions by the Veteran in his treatment by private and VA sources after service as well as by statements from his mother.,EvidenceSentence
There is no contrary competent medical evidence to show otherwise.,EvidenceSentence
Service connection cannot be granted for disability due to intentional drug abuse.,LegalRuleSentence
See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.301(d).,CitationSentence
"As noted above, the Board was directed to address the issue of aggravation of a preexisting disability through consideration of the presumption of soundness.",Sentence
"Here, the evidence shows the Veteran did not report any psychiatric problems on his medical history in August 1975 and no psychiatric issues were identified at the time of the physical examination.",EvidenceSentence
"However, also as noted above, the Court has specifically held that, even in cases where the evidence later shows that there was a preexisting disability that was not identified on entry to service, the presumption of soundness does not necessarily apply.",LegalRuleSentence
"More to the point, absent the showing of the manifestation or incurrence of a disease or injury in service, there is no disability to consider for possible aggravation.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 52 (2012).",CitationSentence
"The Court in Gilbert held that before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury - that was not noted upon entrance into service - manifested in service.",LegalRuleSentence
"Otherwise stated, absent such manifestation, the presumption of soundness is not for application.",LegalRuleSentence
That is the case here.,FindingSentence
"No disability for which compensation may be paid (i.e, a disability which was not a drug induced psychiatric disorder) was manifest in service.",FindingSentence
"Thus, the presumption of soundness is not for application.",FindingSentence
It is clear from the evidence of record that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD that is based on his sexual trauma prior to service.,FindingSentence
"Although the Veteran has given a history of several incidents, his primary incident involves the karate instructor and this has been the basis for the diagnosis by various providers and examiners.",ReasoningSentence
The stressor is unrelated to service.,FindingSentence
"The Veteran's PTSD could not have been aggravated by his military service insofar as this implies that PTSD was present prior to, and during, the Veteran's service.",FindingSentence
"However, no psychiatric disorder other than organic brain syndrome due to drug abuse, which resolved, was present during service.",ReasoningSentence
The Board is of the opinion that the contemporaneous treatment records during service have the greatest probative value as to the Veteran's mental status at that time.,ReasoningSentence
This is particularly true when weighed against lay statements such as those given by the Veteran or in various written statements from persons who knew him during and after service.,ReasoningSentence
PTSD also was not present when the Veteran was treated as an outpatient or when he was hospitalized in the 1980s.,EvidenceSentence
"This diagnosis did not appear until more than 20 years after the Veteran's service; therefore, it could not have been aggravated by service.",ReasoningSentence
"Even more importantly, after a comprehensive review of all of the Veteran's treatment records and the prior medical opinions, the examiner who provided the May 2011 report of examination determined that the Veteran did not have PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder which could have been aggravated by service.",ReasoningSentence
"In summary, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service.",FindingSentence
"Accordingly, the Board concludes that a psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service.",FindingSentence
The Board acknowledges that VA is statutorily required to resolve the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an outstanding issue.,LegalRuleSentence
That doctrine is inapplicable in the instant case because the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim.,FindingSentence
"See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990); 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b).",CitationSentence
"Accordingly, the appeal is denied.",Sentence
Citation Nr: 1303141,Sentence
FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
1. Clear and unmistakable evidence exists that the Veteran manifested a psychiatric disability prior to his service and that the aggravation of that disability during his service was a result of natural progression of the condition.,FindingSentence
2. The Veteran is not service-connected for any disability.,FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS,Sentence
A current disability exists when there is a disability when a claim for it is filed or at any time during the pendency of such claim.,LegalRuleSentence
"McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).",CitationSentence
The Veteran filed this claim in May 2003.,Sentence
"Since then, psychiatric disabilities have been diagnosed.",EvidenceSentence
Diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder were made in VA treatment records and at the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination.,EvidenceSentence
A VA treatment record also documents a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,Sentence
"Therefore, the Veteran currently has a psychiatric disability.",FindingSentence
The law specific to establishing service connection for posttruamatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not discussed herein because the PTSD diagnosis is not valid.,Sentence
The diagnosis of a mental disorder should conform to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).,LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (2012).,CitationSentence
There is no indication of a diagnosis of PTSD conforming to DSM-IV here.,FindingSentence
The DSM-IV is not mentioned in the only VA treatment record diagnosing PTSD and those diagnoses do not contain evidence or discussion to show that the criteria of DSM-IV for the diagnosis are met.,EvidenceSentence
"Further, voluminous VA treatment records and private treatment records dated both before and after this record diagnose a variety of psychiatric disabilities, but not PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"In addition to a current disability, the Veteran manifested a psychiatric disability during service.",FindingSentence
Service medical records show that he was hospitalized in April 1975 with an initial diagnosis of situational reaction after going on unauthorized absence and hiding under a building for three weeks.,EvidenceSentence
"He stayed through mid May 1975 with a primary diagnosis of manic depressive illness, depressed type.",EvidenceSentence
The in-service manifestation necessitates consideration of the presumption of soundness.,Sentence
"Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012) (presumption of soundness applies only when there is manifestation of a disease or injury during service).",CitationSentence
"A Veteran will be presumed to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at that time.",LegalRuleSentence
"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b) (2012); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).",CitationSentence
"Here, the Veteran reported a history of frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble in December1974 just prior to his entry into service.",EvidenceSentence
He further reported having been treated for the mental condition of nervousness.,EvidenceSentence
"His entrance examination, which was conducted the same day, did not find him either psychiatrically normal or abnormal.",EvidenceSentence
It was noted that the Veteran had been hospitalized for mental illness and had seen a psychiatrist.,EvidenceSentence
"He apparently was referred for further evaluation, as he originally was given a rating of 3 for his psychiatric condition but that rating was crossed out in favor of a rating of 1.",EvidenceSentence
"A rating of 3 signifies that the condition or defect may require significant limitations, and usually is a disqualification for service.",ReasoningSentence
A rating of 1 is indicative of a high level of fitness.,ReasoningSentence
The Court noted that a history of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of the condition.,LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b)(1) (2012).,CitationSentence
"Thus, the Veteran's reports of psychiatric symptoms and receiving psychiatric treatment and hospitalization prior to his entrance examination was insufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness.",FindingSentence
The Court further found that noted means only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports.,LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b) (2012).,CitationSentence
"While it was not determined specifically whether or not the Veteran was psychiatrically normal or abnormal at his entrance examination, it ultimately was determined during that examination that he had a high level of psychiatric fitness.",EvidenceSentence
No psychiatric disability was recorded at the entrance examination.,EvidenceSentence
"Therefore, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness for psychiatric disabilities applies.",FindingSentence
The Board next considers whether the presumption that the Veteran was psychiatrically sound upon his entry into service has been rebutted.,Sentence
"The presumption of soundness is rebutted where clear and unmistakable (obvious and manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior to examination, acceptance, and enrollment for service and was not aggravated by service.",LegalRuleSentence
"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b) (2012); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).",CitationSentence
Clear and unmistakable evidence is an onerous evidentiary standard requiring that the conclusion be undebatable.,LegalRuleSentence
"Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116 (2003); Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254 (1999).",CitationSentence
"With respect to an injury or disease existing prior to service, the Board finds that there is clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of soundness.",FindingSentence
"All of the evidence, to include the medical evidence, medical principles, medical judgment, and lay evidence shall be considered.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b) (2012).,CitationSentence
The Veteran's reports of psychiatric symptoms and receiving psychiatric treatment to include hospitalization prior to his entrance examination constitute lay evidence.,ReasoningSentence
"He is a lay person, as there is no indication that he possesses medical knowledge, training, or experience.",ReasoningSentence
"His reports are competent, as the symptoms and treatment described would have been experienced by him personally.",ReasoningSentence
His reports also are credible because there is no reason to doubt them.,ReasoningSentence
They are consistent with the other evidence.,ReasoningSentence
"Medical evidence exists in the form of service medical records and treatment records from a private hospital dated in November 1974, prior to his entrance to service.",EvidenceSentence
"Service medical records document that the Veteran's manic depressive illness, depressed type, was determined by a Medical Board to have existed prior to his entry into service.",EvidenceSentence
The treatment records from a private hospital show that the Veteran had been depressed and suicidal just before he entered service.,EvidenceSentence
He indicated that was because his girlfriend had lost her job.,EvidenceSentence
"The admission diagnosis was schizophrenic reaction, as was the discharge diagnosis.",EvidenceSentence
"Finally, medical judgment considering medical principles exists in that evidence, notwithstanding the assertion of the Veteran's representative to the contrary.",ReasoningSentence
The examiner who conducted the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination opined that the Veteran clearly had a preexisting psychiatric disability when he entered service.,EvidenceSentence
It was noted that the nature of that disability was schizoaffective disorder in its prodromal phases.,EvidenceSentence
Acknowledgement is given to the Veteran's contentions during the pendency of the claim that the ultimate conclusion from his pre-service hospitalization for psychiatric symptoms was simply that he needed to grow up or that he was depressed.,EvidenceSentence
"That is belied by the private treatment records of that hospitalization, particularly the admitting and discharge diagnoses.",ReasoningSentence
Acknowledgement also is given to the contention of the Veteran's representative that the February 2008 VA examiner relied solely on the Veteran's self-reported history in opining that he had a preexisting psychiatric disability when he entered service.,EvidenceSentence
That also is belied by the mere existence of the aforementioned treatment records which document the treatment prior to entrance to service. .,ReasoningSentence
"Regarding aggravation by service, a preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by service when there is an increase in disability during that service.",LegalRuleSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1153 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.306(a) (2012).,CitationSentence
An increase occurs when there is a lasting worsening of the injury or disease rather than simply temporary or intermittent symptom flare-ups.,LegalRuleSentence
"Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183 (1997); Beverly v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 402 (1996); Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529 (1996); Jensen v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 304 (1993); Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 320 (1991); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292 (1991).",CitationSentence
The presumption of aggravation when there is an increase during service is rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase is due to the natural progress of the disease.,LegalRuleSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1153 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.306(a) (2012).,CitationSentence
VA bears the burden to rebut the presumption.,LegalRuleSentence
"Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331 (1993); Akins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 228 (1991).",CitationSentence
"Insufficient evidence of aggravation does not meet the burden, only affirmative evidence proving that there was no aggravation does.",LegalRuleSentence
"Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231 (2012).",CitationSentence
"All of the evidence, to include the medical principles, shall be considered.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.306(b) (2012).,CitationSentence
Acknowledgement is given to the argument of the Veteran's representative that 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1153 (West 2002) only applies if a condition was noted at the time of entry into service.,Sentence
The Board disagrees.,ReasoningSentence
The plain language of the statute does not state that it applies only if a condition was noted at the time of entry into service.,Sentence
The same goes for its companion regulation of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.306(a) (2012).,Sentence
A condition being noted at entry is not mentioned in either the statute or the regulation.,Sentence
"Instead, each calls for application in the event of a preexisting injury or disease.",Sentence
The application of the statute and regulation when a disability was not noted on a service entrance examination but is shown by clear and unmistakable to have preexisted service is discussed in relevant case law.,Sentence
"Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231 (2012).",CitationSentence
No preexisting psychiatric disability was noted at the Veteran's entrance examination.,EvidenceSentence
"However, the Board finds that clear and unmistakable evidence of a preexisting psychiatric disability exists.",FindingSentence
The Board finds that the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability underwent an increase during his service.,FindingSentence
"Whereas the Veteran had a high level of psychiatric fitness when he entered service, he was hospitalized for psychiatric illness after a few months of service.",EvidenceSentence
"Service medical records of his Medical Board show that his manic depressive illness, depressed type, was manifested by severe depression, insomnia, anorexia, loss of weight, difficulty concentrating, withdrawal from others, and feelings of guilt, hopelessness, and worthlessness.",EvidenceSentence
The records show that a conference of psychiatrists concluded his impairment was severe for further service such that further useful service was precluded and was definite for civilian life.,EvidenceSentence
"It was recommended that he be discharged, and that recommendation was implemented.",EvidenceSentence
"Further, the examiner who conducted the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination opined that the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability progressed during service.",EvidenceSentence
"However, the Board finds that the in-service increase in the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability was due to the natural progress of the disability.",FindingSentence
The Board finds that it is unclear whether service medical records indicate that the Medical Board determined that the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability was aggravated by service or not aggravated by service since a mark was placed equally between the boxes for each.,ReasoningSentence
That finding is inconclusive.,ReasoningSentence
That alone is insufficient.,ReasoningSentence
The Medical Board's determination is not accompanied by an explanation.,EvidenceSentence
"Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231 (2012),.",CitationSentence
The rationale for a medical opinion must be articulated.,LegalRuleSentence
"Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007).",CitationSentence
That leaves for consideration the opinion of the examiner who conducted the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination.,Sentence
That February 2008 examiner opined that what happened to the Veteran during service clearly was the natural progression of his preexisting psychiatric disability.,EvidenceSentence
It was noted that there was no evidence that what happened was attributable to his service such that it would not have occurred absent this service.,EvidenceSentence
"His psychiatric disability, which was characterized as chronic, was deemed to have been prompted by the stresses and strains of adult life prior to service.",EvidenceSentence
It further was deemed to have been increased by the stresses and strains of military life in the same way it would have been increased if he had been stressed and strained in some other fashion.,EvidenceSentence
"Specifically, it was determined that stress other than from service probably would have resulted in a psychotic episode requiring hospitalization like the in-service episode from the stress of service which required hospitalization.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran's self-reported increasing stress at work and resulting hospitalization prior to his service was highlighted as an example.,EvidenceSentence
"His response to stress from non-service experiences, namely hospitalizations, further was highlighted.",EvidenceSentence
"Factors that may be considered in assessing the probative value of a medical opinion include a physician's access to the claims file or other pertinent evidence, the thoroughness and detail of the opinion, the accuracy of the factual premise underlying the opinion, the scope of examination, the degree of certainty provided, and the qualifications and expertise of the examiner in addition to the rationale offered.",LegalRuleSentence
"Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000); Black v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 297 (1997); Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405 (1994); Sklar v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 140 (1993); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458 (1993); Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).",CitationSentence
The examiner who conducted the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination is a member of the American Board of Professional Psychology.,EvidenceSentence
This examiner's opinion was rendered following review of the claims file and interview of the Veteran.,EvidenceSentence
No deficiency is found in either respect.,ReasoningSentence
"The Board notes that the Veteran's interview took a ""great deal of time.""",EvidenceSentence
That is shown by the examiner's use of that phrase and the fact that the summarization of the interview is around three pages in length.,ReasoningSentence
There is no indication of reliance on an inaccurate factual premise in formulating the opinion.,ReasoningSentence
A rationale for it was offered by the examiner.,EvidenceSentence
It further is sufficiently thorough and detailed.,ReasoningSentence
Acknowledgement is given to the assertion of the Veteran's representative that the examiner's use of the word probably conveys uncertainty when clear and unmistakable evidence the governing standard.,Sentence
The Board disagrees.,ReasoningSentence
No degree of uncertainty was expressed by the examiner.,EvidenceSentence
The representative has selected one word out of the examiner's opinion and interpreted it out of context.,ReasoningSentence
The examiner clearly found the increase or aggravation of the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability during service to be due to natural progression.,EvidenceSentence
That a psychotic episode he experienced during service probably would have been experienced had he not been in-service but had instead been otherwise occupied bolsters that opinion rather than undermines it.,ReasoningSentence
"The examiner obviously cannot indicate what would have occurred had the Veteran not been in service since he was in service, and any such opinion would be speculative.",ReasoningSentence
"However, the examiner can hypothesize what most likely would have occurred had the Veteran not been in service.",ReasoningSentence
"The hypothesis was that a psychotic episode triggered by stresses and strains such as those on the job, as the Veteran had an episode prior to his entry into service and experienced episodes following his service.",ReasoningSentence
The Board affords the opinion of the examiner who conducted the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination substantial probative value.,ReasoningSentence
The Board finds the opinion to be the most persuasive evidence in this case and to outweigh any conflicting lay evidence.,ReasoningSentence
"It is unnecessary to consider chronicity, continuity of symptomatology, or presumptive service connection in light of that opinion that the in-service increase in the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability is due to natural progression of the disorder.",ReasoningSentence
"The Board finds, that the preponderance of the evidence is against service connection for a psychiatric disability.",FindingSentence
"Accordingly, the claim is denied.",Sentence
"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102 (2012); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).",CitationSentence
Citation Nr: 1315144,Sentence
FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
4. There is no credible supporting evidence that the Veteran's claimed in-service stressors occurred and no evidence a diagnosis of PTSD is etiologically related to the alleged in-service stressors.,FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS,Sentence
"The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for PTSD, which he contends is the result of several in-service stressors.",Sentence
"He reports a nuclear accident while a member of the Yellow Water Nuclear Preparedness team while stationed at Cecil Field in Florida, as well as the constant pressure of having planes crash while working as an air traffic controller.",EvidenceSentence
No dates were provided.,EvidenceSentence
See VA Form 21-0781 received June 2008.,CitationSentence
"The Veteran also reports the fly outs of Vietnamese refugees to Guam and seeing shot up people, dead bodies, and some people dying during flights, and incidents that took place in Agana, Guam, in 1977.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran also reports several plane crashes when numerous people were killed while he was an air traffic controller at Cecil Field between 1978 and 1979.,EvidenceSentence
See October 2008 VA Form 21-0781.,CitationSentence
"The Board notes that an attempt to elicit more information regarding these broadly-described stressors was unsuccessful, see letters dated September 2008, and that a formal finding on a lack of information required to verify stressors was made.",ReasoningSentence
See February 2009 memorandum.,CitationSentence
The Board also notes that the Veteran's service personnel records do not corroborate any service in Guam.,EvidenceSentence
"Given the foregoing, there is no credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors occurred.",FindingSentence
"The Veteran's service treatment records document complaints related to sleep walking, nightmares, uneasiness and nervousness, poor sleep/ trouble sleeping, and irritability.",EvidenceSentence
"There was no mention, however, that any of these complaints were related to any specific stressor, to include those reported by the Veteran on his VA Forms 21-0781.",EvidenceSentence
"In fact, an April 1980 impression of adult situational reaction to adult life was made in reference to feeling worried about his grandparents' state.",EvidenceSentence
"Post-service medical evidence of record reveals that the Veteran has obtained VA mental health treatment, during which he has been diagnosed with PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"There is no indication, however, that he reported the stressors discussed above.",EvidenceSentence
"Rather, the records in which a diagnosis of PTSD was made in connection with a reported stressor indicate that the Veteran recounted the death of his mother when he was ten and physical abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"See e.g., May 2002 psychiatry note.",CitationSentence
"In addition, there is no indication that the diagnosis of PTSD was rendered as a result of any in-service stressor(s).",ReasoningSentence
"Rather, VA mental health treatment records reveal that the Veteran's PTSD is related to his childhood and to his reported physical abuse.",ReasoningSentence
"See e.g., psychiatry notes dated October 2003 and December 2006.",CitationSentence
"The Board acknowledges that during the February 2010 mental disorders VA examination, the Veteran denied suffering from any form of abuse, though he did report the death of his mother when he was ten.",EvidenceSentence
"The Board does not find this assertion, made during a VA examination after the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD was received, to be credible.",ReasoningSentence
"Rather, it finds the assertions made prior to the date on which the Veteran filed for service connection for PTSD more probative.",ReasoningSentence
"See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (a pecuniary interest may affect the credibility of a claimant's testimony).",CitationSentence
The Veteran's credibility is also diminished in light of his step mother's report of witnessing one incident during which his father chased him with a fireplace log and struck him.,ReasoningSentence
See August 2012 statement from M.A.,CitationSentence
The preponderance of the evidence does not support the claim for service connection for PTSD.,FindingSentence
"As noted above, there is no credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors occurred and none of the mental health treatment records that document a diagnosis of PTSD were linked to the alleged stressors.",FindingSentence
"Therefore, the Veteran does not have two of the required elements needed to establish a claim for service connection for PTSD pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).",FindingSentence

FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
5. The Veteran did not have a valid diagnosis of PTSD or have a psychiatric disorder that was causally or etiologically related to his military service.,FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS,Sentence
"Since the Veteran in this case has alleged, and VA examiners have opined, that he had a psychiatric disorder that preexisted service, the Board must consider whether the presumption of soundness is for application.",ReasoningSentence
"In this case, service treatment records include the Veteran's June 1965 pre-induction examination and accompanying report of medical history form.",EvidenceSentence
"On his medical history form, the Veteran said he currently or previously had dizziness or fainting spells, foot trouble, and nervous trouble.",EvidenceSentence
"Concerning this history, the part of the examiner's notes that appear to address the Veteran's notation about nervous trouble is not completely legible, but he noted with regard to the dizziness or fainting spells, foot trouble, and nervous trouble as follows:",EvidenceSentence
"""Occ[asional] postural hypotension"" and ""Dropped cross tie on 3rd R[ight] toe"" and ""Mildly [illegible]"".",EvidenceSentence
"The accompanying examination report reflected a clinical evaluation of the psychiatric system of ""normal"".",EvidenceSentence
"Accordingly, because only a history of nervous trouble provided by the Veteran was shown on the entrance examination report, the Board finds that a psychiatric disorder was not ""noted"" at entry to service.",FindingSentence
The remaining question with regard to whether the presumption of soundness applies in this case is whether a psychiatric disorder manifested or was incurred in service.,Sentence
"Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 53 (2012) (noting that before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service manifested or was incurred in service), citing Holton, 557 F.3d at 1367 (the presumption of soundness does not ""relieve the veteran of the burden of showing that [he] suffered from a disease or injury while in service""); Horn, 25 Vet.App. at 236 (""In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service.""); see also Dye v. Mansfield, 504 F.3d 1289, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (presumption of soundness involves question of preexistence of ""medical problems that arose during service""); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (disability compensation requires ""'personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty'"" (quoting 38 U.S.C. Â§ 1110)).",CitationSentence
"In this case, the evidence does not show that PTSD, depression, or any other psychiatric disorder was treated or diagnosed during service.",FindingSentence
"At separation from service, the Veteran indicated nervous trouble on his report of medical history form; however, the reviewing physician indicated that positive answers on the report were not of medical significance.",EvidenceSentence
The accompanying examination report shows a normal psychiatric evaluation.,EvidenceSentence
The only evidence of onset of a psychiatric disorder during service is the Veteran's conflicting post-service statements to VA and private medical providers regarding the onset of his psychiatric disorder.,ReasoningSentence
"He has stated that his condition had its onset prior to service, during his first physical for basic training, upon leaving Vietnam, and after service in the 1970s.",EvidenceSentence
"He has also said he was treated for his condition with sleeping pills while serving in Vietnam; however, service treatment records do not support his contention.",EvidenceSentence

The Board has considered the Veteran's post-service statements regarding the onset of a psychiatric disorder in service and finds that his inconsistent statements are not sufficient evidence on which to base a finding that a psychiatric disorder manifested during service.,ReasoningSentence
"Further, as discussed below, none of the medical evidence indicates that a psychiatric disorder had its onset during service, and psychiatric disorders are complex matters requiring medical evidence for diagnosis; they are not the kind of disorders that subject to lay observation.",ReasoningSentence

The VA regulation governing claims for service connection for PTSD has recently been amended.,Sentence
"Effective July 13, 2010, VA has amended its adjudication regulations by liberalizing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.",Sentence
"Specifically, the final rule amends 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f) by redesignating current paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) as paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), respectively, and by adding a new paragraph (f)(3) that reads as follows:",Sentence
"(f)(3) If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.",LegalRuleSentence
"For purposes of this paragraph, ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity"" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.",LegalRuleSentence

"In this case, service records show that the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam as an aircraft instrument repairman.",EvidenceSentence
His awards and decorations include the Vietnam Service Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.,EvidenceSentence
"Service treatment records do not show that the Veteran complained of or was treated for any acquired psychiatric disorders or symptoms during service; however, at separation from service, the Veteran indicated nervous trouble on his report of medical history form.",EvidenceSentence

The accompanying examination report did not indicate psychiatric abnormalities.,EvidenceSentence
"The first indication of a psychiatric disorder is dated December 1989, approximately 22 years after separation from service, and is located in a treatment record from MCC Center.",EvidenceSentence
The treatment record shows the Veteran reported having been treated for mental health symptoms since the 1970s.,EvidenceSentence
"He noted that while in Vietnam, he was stationed in an area that received mortar fire.",EvidenceSentence
The diagnosis was adjustment disorder with depressed mood and generalized anxiety disorder.,EvidenceSentence
"In April 1990, MCC Center discussed changing the diagnosis to generalized anxiety disorder due to the reported history of treatment for nerves and increased symptoms pervasive in daily functioning.",EvidenceSentence
MCC Center staff did not discuss the etiology of the disorder.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran had VA examinations in June and July 1990.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiners interviewed the Veteran but did not indicate that the claims file was available for review; therefore, opinions provided in the examination reports are not adequate for rating purposes.",ReasoningSentence
"Briefly, the June 1990 VA examination report shows the Veteran said he had been treated by a psychiatrist since service for his mental health.",EvidenceSentence
The diagnosis was generalized anxiety disorder.,EvidenceSentence
Psychosocial stressors included finances and his unemployment.,EvidenceSentence
The July 1990 VA examination report shows testing indicated mild depression but not PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner said the Veteran experienced mild levels of depression, which could have been in reaction to current stressors.",EvidenceSentence

"In September 1992, the Veteran had a psychiatric evaluation performed at CVPC.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner interviewed the Veteran and documented his current symptoms and reported history.,EvidenceSentence
"The diagnosis was dysthymic disorder; however, the examiner did not indicate the etiology of the disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran had another VA examination in May 1993.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner did not have the claims file for review and did not provide an etiology opinion.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner interviewed the Veteran and diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner indicated that chronic PTSD needed to be ruled out.,EvidenceSentence
"In April 1999, the Veteran had a VA comprehensive mental health evaluation.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran said he had been ""nervous"" since leaving Vietnam.",EvidenceSentence
"Screens were negative for PTSD, bipolar disorder, and psychosis.",EvidenceSentence
"The diagnosis was depression; however, the provider did not indicate the etiology of the disorder.",EvidenceSentence

The examiner said the Veteran did not meet the stressor criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran had nerve problems prior to and subsequent to service but that he did not seek treatment until 1970.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner found no service treatment records showing treatment of a mental health disorder.,EvidenceSentence

"Specifically, while MCC Center diagnosed PTSD based on the Veteran's experiences in Vietnam, a VA or VA contracted provider did not confirm prior to the Veteran's death that his stressor was related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and that it was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"Further, the VA examination conducted one month after the letter was submitted found that the Veteran did not meet all criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"Notably, subsequent VA PTSD screens were negative.",EvidenceSentence
"Consequently, without a diagnosis of PTSD, service connection for PTSD for accrued benefits purposes must be denied.",FindingSentence
"During the pendency of his claim, the Veteran continued to have a diagnosis of depression.",FindingSentence
"However, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence does not show a relationship between depression and service.",FindingSentence
The only evidence indicating a nexus between service and acquired psychiatric disorders are his statements.,EvidenceSentence
"However, as noted above, the Veteran's statements regarding the onset and treatment of his acquired psychiatric disorders are inconsistent.",ReasoningSentence
"Specifically, he said his condition had its onset prior to service, during his first physical for basic training, upon leaving Vietnam, and after service in the 1970s.",EvidenceSentence
"While laypersons are generally competent to report symptoms of disorders, in this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's recollections of his medical history are not consistent and therefore, not credible.",ReasoningSentence
"The Board has considered the medical evidence, but finds that it also fails to indicate a relationship between service and any psychiatric disorders.",FindingSentence
"At most, VA examiners opined that acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD had their onset prior to service.",EvidenceSentence
"The opinions, which are not supported by rationale, appear to be based on the Veteran's statements alleging pre-service onset of his disorders.",ReasoningSentence
"However, because the Board finds that the Veteran's statements regarding his medical history are not credible, the Board, in turn, finds that the VA examiners' opinions are not credible or persuasive and are entitled to no probative value as they are based on the Veteran's reported history.",ReasoningSentence
"Generally, the Board would remand this case to obtain an adequate VA examiner's opinion; however, because this claim is solely for the purpose of accrued benefits, the Board is not permitted to undertake development subsequent to the Veteran's death.",Sentence
"Therefore, based on the evidence of record at the time of the Veteran's death, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence weighs against a finding of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, for accrued benefits purposes.",FindingSentence

FINDING OF FACT,Sentence
"The Veteran does not have posttraumatic stress disorder or another psychiatric disability which manifest or began in service, was aggravated by service, or is causally related to service.",FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION,Sentence
The service treatment records reflect no findings or histories indicative of a psychiatric disorder.,EvidenceSentence
October 1994 treatment records do reflect histories of increased drinking.,EvidenceSentence
"An October 1994 hospital record reflects a history of alcoholism and ""drinking more often for one year.""",EvidenceSentence
"However, a clinic record from the next day reflects the Veteran's history of ""moderate [alcohol] intake (6-7 beers 2x week)"" until four months earlier when he began to cut down.",EvidenceSentence
The November 1994 separation examination record reflects normal clinical findings for the psychiatric system and negative histories as to any symptom suggestive of a psychiatric disorder.,EvidenceSentence
"The service personnel records reflect no findings suggestive of a stressor or psychiatric symptoms; in fact, the records show improvement in the Veteran's performance as his military service progressed.",EvidenceSentence
"The record reveals the Veteran's report of stressors involving a helicopter crash, witnessing public executions/mutilation while in Kuwait City, participation in combat, and military sexual trauma.",EvidenceSentence
The record does not indicate that the Veteran participated in combat.,EvidenceSentence
The record does indicate that the USS Okinawa docked in Kuwait City while the Veteran was on board.,EvidenceSentence
"The record also indicates that a HMM 166 CH-45 crashed while conducting fast rope exercises aboard the USS Duluth, that 14 of 18 passengers were recovered, and that definitive medical care was given onboard USS Okinawa for all but the five most severely injured patients.",EvidenceSentence
"With respect to the reported helicopter crash, although the Veteran's report of a helicopter crash while he was serving on the USS Okinawa is corroborated, the Veteran has provided inconsistent details about his involvement in the crash and its aftermath.",ReasoningSentence
"The Veteran has alleged that he witnessed the helicopter crash in the sea, and in October 2005, he reported that he also rescued people from the crash.",EvidenceSentence
"See, e.g., August and September 2003, May 2004, February, May, and October 2005, April 2007, and August 2009 VA treatment records.",CitationSentence
He has alternately alleged that he did not see the actual crash.,EvidenceSentence
"In August 2003 and June 2005, he reported that he only saw other people carrying the dead and wounded from the crash.",EvidenceSentence
See August 2003 and June 2005 VA treatment records.,CitationSentence
"In June 2006, April 2007, and March 2009, he reported that he carried the bodies of the dead and wounded, and in April 2008, July 2008, August 2008, and January 2010, he reported that he put bodies in body bags.",EvidenceSentence
"See June 2006, April 2007, April 2008, July 2008, August 2008, March 2009, and January 2010 VA treatment records.",CitationSentence
The Veteran has also provided inconsistent details about the military sexual trauma.,ReasoningSentence
"In September 2003, the Veteran reported that when he was stationed in the Philippines, a woman forced oral sex on him.",EvidenceSentence
"In May 2006, however, the Veteran reported that he was raped when he was stationed in Oregon.",EvidenceSentence
He later explained that he went with a woman when he was intoxicated and she sexually assaulted him.,EvidenceSentence
"See, e.g., April 2007 Decision Review Officer hearing transcript.",CitationSentence
"The evidence of record documents treatment for psychiatric symptoms from May 2003, forward.",EvidenceSentence
The record reflects inconsistent histories as to the reported date of onset of the symptoms.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran has reported that he attempted suicide at 18, received counseling for bullying as a child, and exhibited OCD and depressive symptoms since before entering high school.",EvidenceSentence
"He has alternately reported that his symptoms onset during service after the reported stressors, that he was unsure when the symptoms began, and that his PTSD symptoms began after he began attending Group Therapy.",EvidenceSentence
"See, e.g., October 2005, April 2007, July 2008, and January 2010 VA treatment records.",CitationSentence
"At the time of initial VA treatment in May 2003, the Veteran reported a history of depression and use of Zoloft.",EvidenceSentence
"At the time of initial treatment at a Vet Center in July 2003, the Veteran reported a history of homicidal and suicidal ideation since separating from military service.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran explained that, during service, he witnessed public executions and people getting their hands/fingers cut off.",EvidenceSentence
He also reported witnessing a helicopter crash into the sea and people brought up from the crash.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was found to exhibit ""symptoms of PTSD and depression.""",EvidenceSentence
"VA inpatient treatment records dating in August 2003 reflect admission assessments of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder and discharge diagnoses of OCD, major depressive disorder, and PTSD, provisional.",EvidenceSentence
"The inpatient records reflect the Veteran's history of attempting suicide when he was 18 and a finding that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ""did not appear to really be an issue.""",EvidenceSentence
"Subsequent records reflect varying diagnoses, including OCD, PTSD, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline, histrionic dependent traits.",EvidenceSentence
See generally VA treatment records.,CitationSentence
See also October 2006 Disability Report.,CitationSentence
"However, medical records also reveal findings that the Veteran did not have OCD or PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms were largely due to his personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"September 2003 VA treatment records reflect findings of possible over-endorsement of OCD and PTSD symptoms in order to get ""needs met"" and a psychologist's determination that the Veteran was ""naively presenting himself in the worst possible manner,"" which raised the question of ""whether there is a disability-related motivation complicating [the Veteran's] presentation.""",EvidenceSentence
"In an addendum, the psychologist noted that the Veteran had attended a PTSD group, indicating concern that the Veteran attended to ""learn about how to have PTSD.""",EvidenceSentence
"The psychologist had the impression that the Veteran's friend, who had taken the Veteran to the PTSD group, may be ""diagnosing' the Veteran and helping create pathology.""",EvidenceSentence
September and October 2003 VA medical records reflect an examiner's determination that the Veteran likely did not have OCD.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner explained that the reported anxiety and OCD symptoms were inconsistent and atypical; the examiner believed the anxiety/depression symptoms were ""in the context of mixed personality disorder.""",EvidenceSentence
"A March 2004 VA treatment record reflects a psychologist's determination that the Veteran was ""clearly invested in having OCD and PTSD,"" though the psychologist ""continue[d] to suspect that [the Veteran's] anxiety [was] more of a generalized nature.""",EvidenceSentence
"The psychologist added that the Veteran's spouse ""seem[ed] to suspect that he [was] not completely genuine in his presentation as well.""",EvidenceSentence
"In August 2004, the same psychologist indicated that she continued to conceptualize ""this as a more Axis II presentation"" and that she increasingly suspected the Veteran came to psychotherapy to ""make a case for service connection for PTSD.""",EvidenceSentence
"The psychologist reported a belief that the Veteran's ""main problems"" were affective dysregulation, including anxiety and anger, related to cluster B traits and that the Axis 1 diagnoses were most likely generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The psychologist added that she did not think the Veteran had OCD or PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
A June 2004 VA examination record reflects the Veteran's history of seeing dead bodies which were carried to a location near him following a helicopter crash.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran indicated that he did not know the men or see them injured or killed.,EvidenceSentence
"After examination and review of the record, the examiner diagnosed major depressive disorder, OCD, and mixed personality disorder with primarily dependent and cluster B traits.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner explained that the Veteran endorsed several criteria consistent with multiple potential diagnoses.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner believed the major depressive disorder and potential OCD likely preceded the Veteran's service based on the history of a suicide attempt at 18, past histories of obsessive behavior (i.e. checking behavior and washing behavior since adolescence), and ongoing difficulty with depression and suicidal ideation.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner added that the depressive symptoms, mood lability, and suicidal ideation could be related to the personality disorder, which would have preceded military service.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner indicated that although the Veteran endorsed several symptoms of PTSD, it was not diagnosed for several reasons.",EvidenceSentence
"First, the examiner explained that the overall level of traumatic exposure appeared ""very low:"" the history of seeing dead bodies was not significantly deviant from many people's common experience, where people see dead bodies in a hospital setting or funeral and the Veteran did not describe feeling in danger for his own life during the experience.",EvidenceSentence
"Second, the examiner explained, the level of symptom reporting seemed rather severe given the level of traumatic exposure: the Veteran reported that all his symptoms worsened significantly or started after seeing the bodies, explaining that he could no longer get along with others and had difficulty interacting, but the Veteran denied any disciplinary problems or performance problems for the remainder of service.",EvidenceSentence
"Finally, the examiner explained, multiple treatment records reflected concern of over-reporting and over-endorsing which, when included with the above information, made the examining unable to accurately diagnose PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that VA inpatient records did not reflect a primary diagnosis of PTSD and reflected a finding that the PTSD symptoms likely had minimal contribution to the Veteran's current symptom state.,EvidenceSentence
"Thus, the examiner found the diagnosed conditions more likely than not preceded service and were not likely exacerbated beyond normal progression by service.",EvidenceSentence
"Furthermore, the examiner found the reported symptoms of PTSD were not consistent with the level of stressor experienced.",EvidenceSentence
"An August 2008 VA treatment record indicates that the psychologist had done a ""detailed review of the Veteran's mental health notes and comp and pen claims.""",EvidenceSentence
The psychologist noted that the record included concerns that the Veteran seemed to be trying to learn about various diagnoses by presenting to many groups to which he was not referred by staff.,EvidenceSentence
The psychologist indicated a belief that the diagnosis of PTSD was put into the medical chart in error due in part to the Veteran's histories of PTSD symptoms and histories of being diagnosed with PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
The psychologist further noted that a June 2004 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
The psychologist indicated concern that the Veteran had a long history of over-reporting symptoms.,EvidenceSentence
"A September 2008 VA treatment record reports that it had been shown that the Veteran's ""symptoms of PTSD have changed and grown out of his contact with mental health providers, and that no debilitating effects were noted for the [second] half of his term with the military, following exposure to what he has cited as his traumatic event.""",EvidenceSentence
"The record reflects diagnoses of major depressive disorder, OCD by history, and mixed personality disorder with predominantly dependent and cluster B traits.",EvidenceSentence
February 2009 VA treatment records indicate findings that a diagnosis of malingering was warranted based on evaluation and that the diagnoses of OCD and PTSD could not be substantiated.,EvidenceSentence
"The records add that although it appeared highly probable that the Veteran was feigning psychiatric symptomatology, the Veteran did appear to have clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression which may be best captured with diagnoses of anxiety disorder and mood disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"The records add that the Veteran's ""malingering' appeared characterologic, not aimed at secondary gain.""",EvidenceSentence
See also April 2009 VA treatment record.,CitationSentence
Subsequent records reflect diagnoses of mood disorder and borderline personality disorder.,EvidenceSentence
"A VA physician later opined that although malingering was suspected, it was not ""at all clear"" as Veteran's presentation and history were ""quite convincing for real mental illness, e.g., borderline p[ersonality] d[isorder] or schizoaffective.""",EvidenceSentence
"The physician reported diagnoses of mood disorder not otherwise specified, OCD by history, and Axis II personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"See, e.g., August and September 2009, November 2012 VA R.W. treatment records.",CitationSentence
An August 2010 VA examination record indicates that the examiner reviewed the claims file and conducted a medical assessment.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner noted that ""as of late, the Veteran's ongoing diagnoses have not included PTSD"" and that ""fairly recent psychological testing indicated findings of Axis 2 Malingering, mood disorder not otherwise specified, and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified with prominent Axis II psychopathology.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner added that it ""should be noted that in not one of the ongoing recent mental health records is there conclusive evidence of the Veteran having mental health symptoms or problems related directly to his time in service.""",EvidenceSentence
The record indicates that the Veteran reported stressors of having to transport and body bag six people who had died in a helicopter crash.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner found this stressor was a low level of traumatic stress exposure.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner reported that, upon questioning, the Veteran endorsed enough symptoms to qualify for a diagnosis of PTSD based on his military trauma exposure.",EvidenceSentence
"However, based on review of the record and the Veteran's verbal report, the examiner could not conclude that the Veteran had PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner indicated that it was less likely than not that the Veteran had PTSD that was related to service.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner explained that this opinion was based on the ""fairly clear history of over-reporting symptoms and outright malingering.""",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner did believe the Veteran had an anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, to include OCD symptoms, as well as a likely mood disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner believed it was at least as likely as not that these conditions preceded service.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner added that there was not convincing medical evidence that the conditions were permanently aggravated by service.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner also believed the Veteran had an Axis II personality disorder which was also less likely as not aggravated by service.,EvidenceSentence
"An August 2012 VA examination record reveals that the Veteran initially denied any psychiatric problems prior to service, though he later reported counseling and a suicide attempt prior to service when asked about a past histories.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran reported that in approximately 1994, he was drinking and a ""girl took [him] back to the barracks"" and raped him.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran reported behavioral disturbance manifested in anger problems and missing formation in service which he related to in-service stressors.,EvidenceSentence
The report indicates that the examiner was unable to locate any markers to suggest occurrence of the alleged sexual assault or corroborate the alleged sexual assault.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner noted that there was a service treatment record for complaints of irritation of the penis, but it preceded the alleged military sexual trauma by two years.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner found it was less likely as not that this stressor occurred; thus, the examiner did not consider this stressor when determining whether the Veteran had PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the other reported stressor (carrying bodies and seeing injured and dead bodies after a crash) met criteria A for a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran endorsed all symptoms of PTSD when asked.,EvidenceSentence
"However, the examiner determined the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD that conformed to the DSM-IV criteria.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner explained that the Veteran answered affirmatively to virtually all symptoms and linked all symptoms to the in-service events, but he was unable to report symptoms or elaborate much about symptoms.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner added that when asked to do so, the Veteran repeated the words used by the examiner and when asked yes/no questions, the Veteran answered affirmatively.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner found the endorsement of symptoms was out of proportion to the level of trauma exposure related to the reported crash.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner indicated that, given the Veteran's diagnosed personality disorder, patterns of reporting, previous testing showing malingering, and absence of a current diagnosis of PTSD, the examiner would not diagnose PTSD because it was felt the Veteran was over-reporting either related to his severe personality disorder or malingering.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner added that regarding the claimed sexual trauma, the examiner was unable to cite any medical evidence or markers of the claimed event and the examiner found the Veteran's history was not reliable based on the above.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with mood disorder not otherwise specified, OCD by history, and mixed personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner opined that the mood disorder and OCD preceded military service.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner added that personality disorders were not caused by service.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner found it was less likely than not that the Veteran had PTSD or any mental disorder that was caused by or aggravated beyond normal progression by military service.,EvidenceSentence
Service connection is not warranted for a psychiatric disability.,FindingSentence
"Initially, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for PTSD.",FindingSentence
The Board acknowledges that the record includes diagnoses of PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"The records reflecting diagnoses of PTSD do not reveal an explanation as to how the Veteran met the criteria for PTSD, however; as such, the Board finds the diagnoses have limited probative value.",ReasoningSentence

The Board finds the probative value of the findings of no PTSD outweighs the probative value of the findings of PTSD.,ReasoningSentence
"Thus, the Board finds the Veteran does not have PTSD.",FindingSentence
Service connection is also not warranted for a psychiatric disability other than PTSD.,FindingSentence
The Board acknowledges that the probative evidence indicates that the Veteran has a mood disorder.,EvidenceSentence

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has reported that his psychiatric symptoms began during service.,EvidenceSentence

FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
8. There was no in-service PTSD stressor and no psychiatric disorder or symptoms of a psychiatric disorder occurred during active service.,Sentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS,Sentence
II.D. Psychiatric Disability Claim,Sentence
There are particular requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD.,Sentence
Establishing service connection for PTSD requires (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.,LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
"The diagnosis of PTSD must comply with the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM- IV).",LegalRuleSentence
"Id., see also 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (2013).",CitationSentence
The evidence required to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor depends upon the nature of the stressor.,LegalRuleSentence
"Special provisions allow that the occurrence of a claimed in-service stressor can be shown by certain kinds of credible supporting evidence where the claimed stressor involved personal assault, fear of enemy or terrorist activity, combat, service as a prisoner of war (POW), or diagnosis of PTSD during service.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
None of the stressors reported by the Veteran fit into these categories.,ReasoningSentence
"In cases such as this, credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the stressor must be provided by someone other than the Veteran and cannot be provided solely by after the fact medical nexus evidence.",LegalRuleSentence
"See generally Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997).",CitationSentence
The Board has considered all psychiatric conditions for which the Veteran has been diagnosed in determining whether service connection is warranted in this case.,ReasoningSentence
"In July 2010, the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.",Sentence
"In September 2010, he reported four incidents that he contends caused his PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"First, that in 1987, in Okinawa, he was involved in a helicopter crash that injured other service personnel.",EvidenceSentence
He reported that he was in the helicopter and involved in a rescue mission of POWs / hostages.,EvidenceSentence
"He also reported that in 1985, in Bridgeport, California, he was banged up pretty bad while repelling from a helicopter when the helicopter above him crashed.",EvidenceSentence
"He reported that in 1983, while at Camp Pendleton, California, another serviceman was standing near the Veteran and blew his finger off of his right hand with a blasting cap.",EvidenceSentence
"Finally, he reported that he was in a violent motor vehicle accident involving him rolling his car over two times and a resulting fire.",EvidenceSentence
At the time of his claim he submitted a July 2010 report of a psychological evaluation signed by a private psychologist.,EvidenceSentence
The psychologist recorded the Veteran's reports of his military service.,EvidenceSentence
"He reported to her that he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1977, completed boot camp and cook school, was later stationed in Okinawa for approximately thirty-two months, attended Marine security guard school in Quantico but was kicked out as a result of conflict, was later transferred to a Naval Air Facility in Sicily for two years, had a five month break in service, and then served three years at Camp LeJeune and three more years in a truck company in Orlando, Florida.",EvidenceSentence
The psychologist documented the Veteran's report that during military service he rolled a car resulting in a whiplash injury to his neck and bruising and swelling of his right knee and leg.,EvidenceSentence
"Also documented in her report was the Veteran's report that he had broken a finger of his left hand while playing softball, that he got banged up when he fell from a cliff during rock assault climbing, and that he twisted his ankle on a forced march, suffered heat stroke, was stabbed in his right arm during military service in the Marine Corps reserves, and that he self treated the wound.",EvidenceSentence
He reported alcohol related problems three years prior to the evaluation.,EvidenceSentence
He also reported that his military occupational specialty was that of a cook.,EvidenceSentence
"As to trauma exposure, the Veteran reported that he was injured in a car accident in 1978 or 1979 that resulted in right leg and cervical spine injuries, and he thought he was dead when the accident occurred.",EvidenceSentence
He also reported that during his service in 1983 at Camp Pendleton a Marine standing next to him blew off several fingers with a blasting cap.,EvidenceSentence
He reported that in 1985 he was repelling from a helicopter into a landing zone and the helicopter crashed and he was banged up as a result.,EvidenceSentence
"He reported that he was involved in a helicopter crash off the coast of Okinawa, and identified this as likely occurring in 1987.",EvidenceSentence
He reported other criminal legal matters arising out of events in the year 2000 and alcohol related problems three years prior to the evaluation.,EvidenceSentence
He also reported that his military occupational specialty was that of a cook.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner provided Axis I diagnoses of PTSD, mood disorder not otherwise specified, and alcohol abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"Although she did not specifically state that the diagnosed disorders were related to his military service, she referred to his military service when discussing the criteria for diagnosing PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"Documented in the August 2010 chiropractor report is that the Veteran has symptoms of PTSD and, in the chiropractor's opinion, the Veteran has PTSD and that this is an incurable permanent condition.",EvidenceSentence
The preponderance of evidence is against a finding that any of the reported in-service stressors occurred.,FindingSentence
"In this regard, the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's reports of in-service events are not credible.",ReasoningSentence
"There are two DD Form 214s of record, one for period of active service from July 1980 to July 1984 and one for the period from January 1985 to January 1988.",EvidenceSentence
"For the period from July 1980 to July 1984, he had one year, one month, and twenty-seven days of foreign service and his awards for that period include a sea service deployment ribbon.",EvidenceSentence
"For the period from January 1985 to January 1988, he had four days of sea service and no foreign service.",EvidenceSentence
This is evidence against a finding that he ever served in Okinawa during the period that he reports such service.,ReasoningSentence
This is inconsistent with his reports noted above.,ReasoningSentence
His reports are therefore afforded little probative weight.,ReasoningSentence
"Lay evidence can be sufficient to prove service connection, but due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of such veteran's service as shown by such veteran's service record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran served, such veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.",LegalRuleSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1154(a) (West 2002).,CitationSentence
"All evidence shows that the Veteran's MOS was that of a cook and there are numerous fitness reports from 1985, 1987, and 1988 that refer to his duties as a cook.",EvidenceSentence
Injuries involving repelling from helicopters and in helicopter training to rescue POWs and hostages is inconsistent with the Veteran's documented service.,ReasoningSentence
"This inconsistency tends to show that his reports of those in-service stressors are not credible, further reducing the probative weight afforded his statements.",ReasoningSentence
The July 2010 psychological evaluation report and the August 2010 chiropractor report are based entirely on the Veteran's report of his service.,EvidenceSentence
The most probative evidence shows that his reports of his service are not credible and therefore the July 2010 psychological evaluation report and the August 2010 chiropractor report are afforded only the most minimal of probative weight.,ReasoningSentence
His service treatment records include numerous normal clinical psychiatric evaluations documented in reports of medical examination over the course of his military service.,EvidenceSentence
There is no mention of a psychiatric condition or symptoms of a psychiatric condition until many years after his separation from active service.,EvidenceSentence
"The Board therefore concludes that the preponderance of evidence shows that the in-service element of service connection is not met with regard to any psychiatric disability claim, including whether service connection is warranted for a mood disorder.",FindingSentence
"As to the PTSD issue specifically, the Veteran's own reports, which is the only evidence favorable to his claim of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, are not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of any reported in-service stressor.",FindingSentence
The Board is aware that he reported that he was stabbed in the leg during Reserve duty.,EvidenceSentence
"However, nowhere is that listed as a stressor related to PTSD or as an event related to any other diagnosed psychiatric disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"Hence, the special provisions for claims involving in-service personal assault stressors do not apply in this case.",FindingSentence
It is further noted there are additional reasons why service connection is not warranted for the diagnosed alcohol abuse and personality disorder.,ReasoningSentence
Applicable law and regulation provide that compensation shall not be paid if disability was the result of a veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.,LegalRuleSentence
"38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 105, 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.1(n), 3.301(c) (2013).",CitationSentence
"Effective for claims filed after October 31, 1990, Section 8052 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, Â§ 8052, 104 Stat. 1388, prohibits payment of compensation for a disability that is a result of a Veteran's own alcohol or drug abuse and amended 38 U.S.C.A Â§ 105(a) to provide that an injury or disease incurred during active service will not be deemed to have been incurred in the line of duty if the injury or disease was a result of the Veteran's own willful misconduct, including abuse of alcohol or drugs.",LegalRuleSentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 105; 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.1(n), 3.301.",CitationSentence
The Federal Circuit has held that 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 105 and Â§ 1110 preclude compensation for primary alcohol abuse disabilities and secondary disabilities that result from primary alcohol abuse.,LegalRuleSentence
"Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001).",CitationSentence
"The decision explains that ""primary alcohol abuse"" means an alcohol abuse disability arising during service from voluntary and willful drinking to excess.",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"However, the Federal Circuit has held that service connection is warranted when drug or alcohol abuse results secondarily from a service-connected disability, but compensation should only result ""where there is clear medical evidence establishing that the drug or alcohol abuse disability is indeed caused by the veteran's primary service-connected disability.""",LegalRuleSentence
"Id. at 1371, 1381.",CitationSentence
"In the instant case, the Veteran has no service-connected disability.",FindingSentence
The law therefore prohibits service connection for alcohol abuse under the facts of the instant case.,Sentence
"Congenital or developmental defects, refractive error of the eye, personality disorders and mental deficiency are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(c).,CitationSentence
"As the Veteran's personality disorder is not a disease or injury within the meaning of applicable legislation, service connection is not warranted for disability due to his personality disorder.",FindingSentence
"For these reasons, the Board must deny the appeal as to entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include a mood disorder, PTSD, and alcohol abuse.",FindingSentence
There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved as to this issue.,FindingSentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102 (2013); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).",CitationSentence

FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
"2. A psychiatric disorder was not ""noted"" at service entrance.",FindingSentence
3. The presumption of soundness does not apply as it is not shown that the Veteran's PTSD manifested during her service.,FindingSentence
"4. The Veteran is currently diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.",FindingSentence
"5. In-service stressors, sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, have been verified.",FindingSentence
"6. The Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder did not begin during her military service, and are not otherwise related to service, to include as a result of her verified in-service stressor; the evidence similarly fails to establish that an Axis I acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated during her military service.",FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION,Sentence
"Here, the Veteran contends that she currently experiences symptoms of PTSD, including nightmares and flashbacks of various events that she photographed and from pictures that she processed while working as a still photographer in service.",EvidenceSentence
"As such, she believes that her current psychiatric problems are related to her military service.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran also asserted that she was placed on medical hold shortly after she entered service, and testified that not knowing whether she would be able to continue her military service caused her a great deal of stress.",EvidenceSentence
"Initially, the Board must determine whether the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1111, 1132 applies in this case.",Sentence
"The relevant evidence on this question includes a February 2007 VA examination report where the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran suffered PTSD in her youth and that this was ""possibly aggravated"" by service.",EvidenceSentence
"Although this evidence suggests that an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, pre-existed entrance into service, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that an acquired psychiatric disability existed prior to service as required under 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1111, 1132.",FindingSentence
"In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran was found to be psychiatrically normal at a November 1984 physical examination prior to entrance into service.",FindingSentence
"Further, although the Veteran has acknowledged that she had a childhood history of abuse, she has also stated that she did not have psychiatric problems upon entry into service.",EvidenceSentence
"On a medical history survey completed in conjunction with her enlistment physical, the Veteran denied any history of nervous trouble, frequent trouble sleeping, or depression.",EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, in the most recent June 2013 VA examination report, conducted pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, the VA examiner acknowledged that there was no pre-service medical documentation suggesting that the Veteran's PTSD had its onset prior to service, and thus concluded that the Veteran's PTSD did not pre-exist service.",EvidenceSentence
"However, as noted, the presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 54 (2012).",CitationSentence
The Court has cautioned that the presumption of soundness is not a sword for a veteran to fulfill the second element of service connection without any evidence of the manifestation of an in-service disability.,Sentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"Otherwise stated, before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service manifested or was incurred in service.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the presumption of soundness does not ""relieve the veteran of the burden of showing that [he] suffered from a disease or injury while in service""); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2012) (""In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service."").",CitationSentence
"Here, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD manifested during service.",FindingSentence
"As the examiner in June 2013 explained, the service treatment records did not show the diagnosis of any psychiatric disability.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran was referred for a mental health consultation in June 1990 to evaluate the Veteran's extreme gullibility and low self-esteem.,EvidenceSentence
"Specifically in June 1990, just two months before separation, the Veteran was evaluated by the chief of the mental health clinic.",EvidenceSentence
"However, no Axis I psychiatric disability was diagnosed following that evaluation.",EvidenceSentence
"As such, there is no showing that the Veteran had an Axis I psychiatric disability during service.",FindingSentence
"To the extent that the Veteran has alleged that she did experience psychiatric problems during service, the Board finds that she lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the etiology of a psychiatric disability.",ReasoningSentence
"See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).",CitationSentence
"Moreover, the medical officer evaluated the Veteran during service, but found that her reported symptoms did not warrant the diagnosis of an Axis I psychiatric disability.",EvidenceSentence
"As was explained, absent the predicate finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service, the presumption of soundness is not for application.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Gilbert, supra.",CitationSentence
"Of note, in Gilbert, as here, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability post-service, but the diagnosis was not rendered during service and there was no indication that the disability onset or was present during service.",ReasoningSentence
"In Gilbert, the Veteran complained of several incidents in service which he believed caused his psychiatric disability.",Sentence
"However, the Court explained that in such a circumstance, the presumption of soundness did not attach.",Sentence
"As such, even though the Veteran has since service identified several in-service stressors which could support a PTSD diagnosis, the evidence does not show an in-service manifestation of any Axis I psychiatric disability.",FindingSentence
"Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application.",FindingSentence
"The analysis does not stop here, as it must now be determined whether the evidence of record makes it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD was either caused or aggravated by her military service.",Sentence
"The occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events are adequately verified in the record, as her personnel records reflect that she photographically documented an aircraft accident, and a statement from a fellow service photographer, corroborates that she was responsible for documenting plane crashes, child abuse incidents, and spousal abuse incidents, as well as an occasion when a flight-line airman was killed when a landing gear tire exploded.",FindingSentence
"Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran had these experiences during service.",FindingSentence
"Moreover, a VA examiner in June 2013 acknowledged that the Veteran's photographing of horrific and traumatic sights in the military was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"However, the question still remains whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is the result of an in-service stressor.",Sentence
Weighing against the Veteran's claim are service treatment records which are absent for any diagnosis for PTSD.,ReasoningSentence
"Although the Veteran has pointed to a number of outbursts and problems in service as evidence of the onset of an acquired psychiatric disability, the medical evidence of record from service does not actually show that any psychiatric disorder was ever diagnosed despite the fact that these behavioral problems were well-known.",EvidenceSentence
"The record shows that the Veteran was first evaluated by the Chaplin/Family Advocacy Officer at a mental health services clinic in December 1985; however, the mental status examination was within normal limits, and the medical officer indicated that no diagnosis was warranted.",EvidenceSentence
"Subsequent entries in January and March 1986, showed that the Veteran's records were screened for reassignment by mental health services, but again there was no indication of any mental health problems, and that she was again found to be medically eligible for retention in March 1986.",EvidenceSentence
"Other than a single entry in June 1990, shortly before her discharge from service, the service treatment records showed no complaints, abnormalities or diagnosis for any psychiatric problems during service.",EvidenceSentence
"Regarding the June 1990 entry, the service records show that the Veteran was seen by psychiatric services for stress.",EvidenceSentence
No specific findings were reported and no Axis I diagnosis was found to be warranted.,EvidenceSentence
"Further, service records reveal that the Veteran was AWOL on the day that she was seen at the mental health clinic in June 1990, and subsequently received nonjudicial punishment (Article 15) for her actions, which included punching a hole in a wall.",EvidenceSentence
"The records show that the Veteran was given a general discharge from service in August 1990, based on a pattern of misconduct during service that, in addition to her Article 15, included dereliction of duty, writing a bad check, and failing a dormitory inspection.",EvidenceSentence
"A review of her Airman Performance Reports showed that in her first year of service (September 1985 to September 1986), the Veteran received an overall rating of 7 by her supervisor (on a scale of zero to nine).",EvidenceSentence
"The evaluation report indicated that the Veteran had progressed at a slow but satisfactory rate, that she needed constant supervision, and that she lacked the ability to grasp both the practical and technical aspects of her job.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to E-3 by her commanding officer in December 1986, based on her supervisor's recommendation that she was not progressing in a satisfactory manner and did not pay attention to detail.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran's next two annual performance evaluations (1986 to 1987 and 1987 to 1988) showed marked improvement in her duty performance and attitude, and she was given an overall score on nine on both reports.",EvidenceSentence
"However, her evaluations from September 1988 to September 1989, and September 1989 to March 1990, showed that her quality of work steadily deteriorated and was inconsistent and unpredictable.",EvidenceSentence
"She was counseled numerous times on the condition of her dormitory room, her personal hygiene and the condition of her uniform with little or no improvement.",EvidenceSentence
"She had angry outbursts at work and in the dormitory which alienated the Veteran from her peers, and despite financial counseling regarding several overdue accounts at various local businesses, she continue to spend to excess.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to sergeant in October 1989, but was subsequently recommended and promoted to E-5 in February 1990.",EvidenceSentence
"However, in July 1990, the Veteran's commanding officer recommended that the Veteran's appointment (promotion) be vacated.",EvidenceSentence
"In a letter to her senior rating supervisor (Command Sergeant Major) dated in July 1990, the Veteran wrote that she realized that she had not performed as well as she could have aver the previous six months because of serious financial and personal problems, but she believed that she had finally straightened things out and wanted to continue her military service.",EvidenceSentence
"On a Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.",EvidenceSentence
"As described, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's PTSD was diagnosed either during her military service or for many years thereafter.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran even acknowledged in her testimony that she did not have any psychiatric problems during service and she denied seeking any psychiatric treatment or reporting any psychiatric problems during her service, including at the time of discharge from service.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, no psychiatric disorder was diagnosed at the time of discharge from service.",EvidenceSentence
These pieces of evidence weigh heavily against a finding that the Veteran's later diagnosed PTSD was incurred in or is otherwise related to her military service.,ReasoningSentence
"Further, in the June 2013 VA examination report, the examiner found that while the Veteran did have a repeated pattern of misconduct during service, it was a result of her personality disorder, and not PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The Board finds the June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative as the examiner conducted an in-depth review of the claims file, and provided a detailed rationale for all opinions rendered.",ReasoningSentence
"See Prejean, 13 Vet. App. at 448-9.",CitationSentence
"For these reasons, the Board finds that PTSD was not incurred in service and was not evidenced by the numerous outbursts and problems in service.",FindingSentence
Also weighing against a finding of a link between the currently diagnosed PTSD and the in-service stressor events are the post-service treatment records.,ReasoningSentence
"Review of the VBMS record reveals that the Veteran first initiated contact with a mental health professional in June 2002 at which time the Veteran related that she had been depressed since February 2002 when she left her wife to be involved in an ""alternative lifestyle consisting of bondage and sadomasochism.""",EvidenceSentence
She also went into detail about abuse suffered as a child.,EvidenceSentence
She did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005 when she was psychiatrically hospitalized at the Tucson VA due to depression with suicidal ideation including a plan to jump off a bridge or walk into the desert and never return.,EvidenceSentence
She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily due to the Veteran's ex-wife.,EvidenceSentence
"In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported nightmares about children being beaten and her father harming her sister.",EvidenceSentence
She also reported the death of her fiancÃ© in 1997 as very upsetting.,EvidenceSentence
"She did mention in-service photos of women and children who were beaten, raped, and included a 4-year-old boy with bloody electrical cord marks across his back and chest.",EvidenceSentence
"At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, dreams, and anger.",EvidenceSentence
"Subsequently, in December 2006, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD and dysthymic disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which was predominantly related to childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in February 2007 to assist in determining the nature and etiology of her psychiatric disorders.,EvidenceSentence
"Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner diagnosed PTSD from childhood abuse, possibly aggravated by military service.",EvidenceSentence
"However, the use of ""possibly"" renders the opinion too equivocal to provide the requisite nexus.",ReasoningSentence
"See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993).",CitationSentence
"Pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, the Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in June 2013 to investigate whether the verified in-service stressors caused or aggravated her currently diagnosed PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"As noted, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's verified in-service stressors could support a diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"However, she found that that in the case of this particular Veteran, the events she experienced in the military, although upsetting and stressful, did not appear to be medically sufficient to cause all or part of her particular syndrome of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner observed that as had been stated by both the Veteran and her treatment providers, the Veteran's PTSD and its expressed symptoms primarily pertained to her severe childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the examiner found that the content of the Veteran's re-experiencing symptoms was predominately related to childhood traumas, and there were no avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms described in treatment notes or other documentation that would be relatable to these traumatic events in the military.",EvidenceSentence
"In addition, the majority of treatment notes in the electronic medical record pertain to the Veteran's childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner also observed that more recently, the Veteran had discussed the 1997 car accident in which her fiancÃ© died.",EvidenceSentence
"In recent treatment, she cited this as the most traumatic event experienced.",EvidenceSentence
She also discontinued treatment because discussing this event was triggering memories and anxiety about childhood abuse.,EvidenceSentence
"Notably, the examiner explained that the Veteran had not met Criteria ""B"" under the DSM-IV PTSD criteria (i.e., symptoms of reexperiencing) because her symptoms were predominately related to childhood traumas.",EvidenceSentence
"Similarly, the record did not reflect documentation of symptoms supporting Criteria ""C"" and ""D"" under the DSM-IV (symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal) which were relatable to the Veteran's in-service stressor events.",EvidenceSentence
"Based on these reasons, the June 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's childhood abuse and her fiancÃ©e's death in 1997, and not the in-service events, were the contributing stressors to the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner further opined that currently diagnosed PTSD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service stressors.,EvidenceSentence
"As previously noted, the Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.",ReasoningSentence
The Board also requested the examiner to consider whether the Veteran's repeated misconduct during service was indicative of the onset of her PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner reviewed the records showing that the Veteran had a repeated pattern of misconduct during military service, but suggested that it was a result of her previously diagnosed personality disorder and was not associated with her diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner noted that the Veteran's service treatment records did not show any psychiatric disorder having been diagnosed or any mention of symptoms of anxiety or depression as a result of her stressful experiences as a photographer, and there was nothing to associate her misconduct with the photography.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the examiner noted that the Veteran's performance difficulties were occurring as early as 1986, not long after she entered the military.",EvidenceSentence
"In September 2013, the Veteran's representative argued that the VA examiner had erred by stating that the records do not demonstrate a military stressor that would account for the majority of the symptoms presentation, or that this constituted the bulk of treatment focus, in that the examiner appeared to conclude that it was an all or nothing debate.",Sentence
"The representative suggested that under the liberal at least as likely as not standard there is no need to demonstrate that a ""bulk"" of the problem, or a ""majority"" of the treatment focused only on the service stressors.",Sentence
"The representative acknowledged that the Veteran had readily stated that her childhood trauma was aggravated by the military stressors, and suggested that the VA examiner had failed to discuss the aspect of the conceded trauma dealing with the documentation of child abuse victims during service, and whether this one aspect of the military stressor more than any other could have brought the childhood traumas back up for the Veteran, and even now be hidden amongst the discussion of her own childhood traumas.",Sentence
"The Board has considered this argument, and concurs that an in-service stressor need not be the predominant (that is bulk or majority) cause of PTSD.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, if the portion of the examination report cited by the representative were to be read in isolation, it might appear to leave open the possibility that the Veteran's PTSD could have been aggravated by her in-service experiences.",ReasoningSentence
"However, when the opinion is read in its entirety, the VA examiner's opinion is very clear that she does not believe that the Veteran's corroborated in-service stressors caused or aggravated her PTSD.",ReasoningSentence
"Although the examiner found that the witnessing of a traumatic event, such as the ones experienced by the Veteran during service, would be sufficient to establish Criteria ""A"" under the DSM-IV for PTSD, the examiner explained that in the Veteran's case the evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran met Criteria B, C, or D under the DSM-IV for PTSD as a result of the in-service experiences.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner explained that the symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that the Veteran experienced, and which formed the basis of her PTSD diagnosis, were associated with childhood abuse and not with the Veteran's experiences in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, although the representative has suggested that the examiner failed to use the ""at least as likely as not standard,"" the June 2013 VA examination report directly contradicts this assertion as the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's PTSD was ""less likely than not"" incurred in or caused by the confirmed in-service stressors.",ReasoningSentence
The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her currently diagnosed PTSD to her verified in-service stressor event.,ReasoningSentence
"Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other lay and medical evidence of record.",ReasoningSentence
"Credibility can be generally evaluated by a showing of interest, bias or inconsistent statements; and the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness testimony are also factors that may be considered.",LegalRuleSentence
"Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 510-511 (1995).",CitationSentence
The Board emphasizes that the Court has recognized that personal interest to receive benefits may affect the credibility of the evidence.,ReasoningSentence
"Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991).",CitationSentence
"In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran has made numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements regarding the nature, extent and severity of her psychiatric symptoms during the pendency of this appeal, revising her statements in an attempt to associate her current psychiatric problems to her time in service.",ReasoningSentence
"For example, at her Board hearing the Veteran testified that she never sought psychiatric counseling in service because she did not think that she had any problems.",EvidenceSentence
"She reported first realizing that there was something wrong in approximately 2002, and that after doing some research, she realized that she had all the symptoms described for PTSD, including hypervigilance and panic attacks.",EvidenceSentence
"However, after a meticulous review of all of the medical treatment records of record, the Board has not found a single complaint or report of hypervigilance or panic attacks.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the JMR failed to identify any such symptoms.",EvidenceSentence
"Similarly, while the Veteran testified that she had vivid, recurring nightmares and flashbacks related specifically to her experiences in service several times a week, she never described or reported any such symptoms related to service to any healthcare provider at anytime during the pendency of this appeal, including when examined by VA in 2007.",EvidenceSentence
"Most of the treatment records indicated that she gave a ""vague"" description of her nightmares and flashbacks.",EvidenceSentence
"On the few occasions when she did describe her nightmares and flashbacks, the Veteran reported that they were about the abuse she suffered as a child and of witnessing the rape of her sister.",EvidenceSentence
"At one point, she reported having vivid flashbacks of parts of an incident in which she was raped while living with her father, and said that she had them over and over, daily.",EvidenceSentence
See November 2006 VA treatment note.,CitationSentence
"However, on other occasions, she reported that she could not recall whether she was ever sexually abused as a child.",EvidenceSentence
See February 2007 VAX.,CitationSentence
"In any event, other than at the personal hearing, the Veteran never described any nightmares or flashbacks related to her service experiences at anytime during the pendency of this appeal.",EvidenceSentence
"Further, although the Veteran was treated for psychiatric problems on numerous occasions since May 2005; as described above, she never mentioned any symptoms or problems related to her service experiences as a photographer until more than two years after she first sought psychiatric help.",EvidenceSentence
See July 2007 treatment note.,CitationSentence
"Even then, the Veteran did not relate her current psychiatric problems to any incident in service, and said only that when she hears a child cry, it reminds her of a child she photographed in service that had been abused.",EvidenceSentence
"She reported being physically, sexually and emotionally abused as a child and believed that this was part of her PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The fact that the Veteran would recognize that she had PTSD or at least some symptoms of PTSD in 2002, which she believed was related to service, but did not report any such symptoms as being related to service until some five years later - and more than two years after she initially sought psychiatric treatment - is not believable or credible.",ReasoningSentence
"For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the Veteran's alleged symptoms regarding her service experiences are self-serving and are not credible.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, after taking into account the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology, the June 2013 VA examiner offered a probative medical opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was due to her childhood abuse and death of her fiancÃ©e.",EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, while the Veteran was treated by several other psychiatrists over the years, most of those reports indicate that her current psychiatric problems were related to her childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
The evidence does not demonstrate that any treating healthcare provider suggested that the Veteran's current PTSD was incurred in or caused by her experiences in service.,EvidenceSentence
"Based on the evidence of record, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of relationship between the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD and her corroborated in-service stressor events.",FindingSentence
"Accordingly, the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, and the claim must be denied.",FindingSentence
"Because the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.",FindingSentence
See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.102.,CitationSentence
Service Connection for Other Acquired Psychiatric Disorders,Sentence
"The evidence of record demonstrates that, in addition to PTSD, the Veteran has also been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders, to include major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.",FindingSentence
"As noted in the previous section, a psychiatric disorder was not noted at service entrance and service treatment records are negative for any diagnoses or treatment for major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"In the Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.",EvidenceSentence
"Review of the evidence of record reveals that the Veteran first initiated contact with mental health professionals in June 2002, where she related having been depressed since February 2002, 12 years after service separation.",EvidenceSentence
"Importantly, the Veteran did not relate her depression to service, but instead, stated that it began when she left her wife to be involved in an alternative lifestyle.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005 when she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily related to her ex-wife.,EvidenceSentence
"As noted in the previous section, in a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported nightmares about children being beaten and her father harming her sister.",EvidenceSentence
She also reported the death of her fiancÃ© in 1997 was very upsetting.,EvidenceSentence

"At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, dreams, and anger which was said to have started at age 10.",EvidenceSentence
"Subsequently, in December 2006, the Veteran was diagnosed dysthymic disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which was predominantly related to childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"The Board finds that VA treatment notes of record document an extensive and complex mental health history; however, they do not provide a medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's depression.",EvidenceSentence
"In efforts to obtain a medical opinion on the question of whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorders were etiologically related to service, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2007.",EvidenceSentence
"Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner, in pertinent part, diagnosed gender identity disorder, depressive disorder (in remission), and personality disorder, with histrionic and narcissistic traits.",EvidenceSentence
The VA examiner opined that none of these psychiatric disorders were related to service.,EvidenceSentence
"In support of this opinion, the February 2007 VA examiner reasoned that there was no evidence during the examination that the Veteran was suffering from depression.",EvidenceSentence
"According to the examiner, the suicidal note that the Veteran gave to a counselor in August of 2006 was for attention seeking behavior as the Veteran had a pattern of behavior that would be inferred as narcissistic and/or histrionic.",EvidenceSentence
"It was noted that, since her youth, the Veteran seemed to have had a pattern of seeking attention suggesting a character or personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner further noted that the Veteran also appeared to be troubled about gender issues.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner explained that the Veteran seemed ambivalent and was not aggressively seeking the process with the proper experts to initiate these changes.,EvidenceSentence
"The Board finds the February 2007 VA medical opinion highly probative as the examiner interviewed the Veteran, reviewed the claims file, performed a mental status examination, and provided an opinion supported by a detailed rationale.",ReasoningSentence
"In a subsequent June 2013 VA examination report, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran, in pertinent part, with personality disorder and gender identity disorder, which were found to be unrelated to events in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Although it was noted that the Veteran continued to meet the criteria for a personality disorder diagnosis due to a pervasive pattern of interpersonal problems, inability to conform to some social norms, and limited adaptability to stressful environments, the personality disorder was found to be rooted in severe childhood abuse, and not service.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner opined that the psychiatric disorders were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the service.,EvidenceSentence
"As previously noted, the Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.",ReasoningSentence
"The Board has considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her psychiatric disorders to service; however, for the reasons discussed in detail in the previous section, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other evidence of record.",ReasoningSentence
"The Board also finds that although the Veteran has repeatedly been diagnosed with a personality disorder, a personality disorder is not service connected, and is subject to important restrictions regarding service connection.",FindingSentence

FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
"5. The Veteran's lay account of exposure to enemy mortar and gunfire attacks in Vietnam are credible and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service to include his military occupational specialty (MOS), unit, and assignment and duties, without clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.",FindingSentence
6. The most probative evidence establishes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD in accordance within the applicable VA regulation.,FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS,Sentence
Analysis - Service Connection for PTSD,Sentence
"In this case, the Veteran has contended that he has PTSD attributable to several combat and noncombat-related stressors in Vietnam.",EvidenceSentence
"Specifically, he has asserted that he experienced enemy attacks with gunfire close to his base immediately upon arriving in Vietnam with subsequent, occasional mortar attacks on the base.",EvidenceSentence
"He has also claimed that, while he was riding in transportation convoys to deliver supplies, his unit sustained enemy mortar, artillery, and gunfire attacks on several occasions.",EvidenceSentence
(It is noted however that the Veteran contradicted this story at the September 2011 VA examination when reporting that he was not shot at while travelling in a convoy).,ReasoningSentence
"He has further maintained that one of his ""close friends"" was killed by military security while entering the gates of his base in an apparent accident, but he has noted that he did not witness the event.",EvidenceSentence
He has not provided the name of the deceased soldier.,EvidenceSentence
"In addition, the Veteran has alleged that he had PTSD-related symptoms since service, especially anxiety.",EvidenceSentence
"See July 2013 hearing testimony at pages 23-32; VA psychological examinations dated in December 1991, November 2010, and September 2011; September 2010 stressor statements.",CitationSentence
"Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for PTSD.",FindingSentence
"Initially, the Veteran's service personnel records and Report of Separation from the Armed Forces (DD Form 214) do not reflect receipt of medals, badges, or decorations that specifically denote combat with the enemy.",EvidenceSentence
"His service personnel records and DD Form 214 do document that he received medals and awards, such as the Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal among others, but there is no award that establishes that he engaged in combat.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, his military occupational specialty (MOS) was an armorer/unit supplier, which is not indicative of combat.",EvidenceSentence
He has also never stated that he actually engaged in combat with the enemy.,EvidenceSentence
"Thus, the combat provisions are not for application.",FindingSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(2).,CitationSentence
See also 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(d) (pertaining to combat Veterans).,CitationSentence
"Nevertheless, under the July 13, 2010, liberalizing amendments to the PTSD regulation, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of claimed in-service stressors that are the result of ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity"" in certain instances.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(3).,CitationSentence
"In this regard, the September 2011 VA psychological examiner indicated that the Veteran's alleged stressors of enemy mortar, artillery, and gunfire attacks while travelling in supply convoys and while assigned to his base are related to the ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.""",EvidenceSentence
"In addition, the Board finds that the Veteran's descriptions of the claimed enemy attack stressors are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service in the U.S. Army in Vietnam at that time.",ReasoningSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a).,CitationSentence
The Veteran's DD Form 214 and service personnel records confirm that he served in Vietnam from September 1970 to May 1971 with the 597th Transportation Company in the U.S. Army.,EvidenceSentence
"His MOS as an armorer/unit supplier is also supportive of his assertions that he travelled in supply convoys in Vietnam on occasion, with the possibility of being subject to enemy attack on occasion.",EvidenceSentence
There is no clear and convincing evidence to the contrary that he was not involved in these incidents.,ReasoningSentence
"Thus, under the amended PTSD regulation, the Veteran's lay testimony and statements alone establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors of enemy mortar, artillery, and gunfire attacks while travelling in supply convoys and while assigned to his base.",FindingSentence
See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(3).,CitationSentence
"The Veteran's service treatment records do not reveal complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"However, as to PTSD, an in-service diagnosis is not required.",LegalRuleSentence
See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
"Post-service, the Veteran did report symptoms of nervousness and anxiety in August 1971, which was several months after his discharge from service.",EvidenceSentence
"However, VA psychological testing was normal at that time and did not reveal any mental health disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"With respect to the criteria of a current diagnosis of PTSD, the threshold consideration for any service connection claim is the existence of a current disability.",LegalRuleSentence

"In particular, aside from verification of an in-service stressor, current medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R.

"Under the amended PTSD regulation, effective July 13, 2010, a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, must confirm that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that a Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in order to warrant service connection for PTSD.",LegalRuleSentence

"With regard to the positive evidence, in 2010 and 2011, a private psychologist, Dr. A.G., PhD., diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD due to his Vietnam experiences.",EvidenceSentence
Dr. A.G. believed the Veteran met the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
She added that his particular post-service line of work as a firefighter makes it more likely for him to experience PTSD symptoms or exacerbation of earlier trauma.,EvidenceSentence
"She noted symptoms, such as hypervigilance, reduced sleeping, nightmares, and anxiety.",EvidenceSentence
She indicated that the Veteran was no longer able to work as a firefighter due to his PTSD symptoms.,EvidenceSentence
The conclusion of Dr. A.G. provides some evidence in support of the PTSD claim.,ReasoningSentence
"On the other hand, a December 1991 VA psychological examiner diagnosed with Veteran with generalized anxiety disorder, but would not confirm a diagnosis for PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"However, in rendering this opinion, the VA examiner did not have access to the Veteran's claims folder or any of the treatment records immediately after discharge reflecting the Veteran's complaints of nervousness.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, this VA opinion is entitled to limited probative value.",ReasoningSentence
A November 2010 VA psychological examiner also provided a very detailed discussion of the Veteran's history of psychiatric treatment since discharge from service in 1971.,EvidenceSentence
"The VA examiner discussed the Veteran's in-service stressors thoroughly; however, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD or any other mental disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"The VA examiner indicated that the overall level of stress exposure based on frequency and severity of incident exposure was ""low.""",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner added that the Veteran was ""vague"" as to whether he was horrified at the time of the stressors.",EvidenceSentence
"Notably, the examiner remarked that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD of reporting symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal.",EvidenceSentence
This examination provides strong evidence against the existence of a current PTSD diagnosis attributable to in-service stressors from Vietnam.,ReasoningSentence
"Additionally, a November 2010 VA mental health assessment from a nurse practitioner indicated that a diagnosis of PTSD had to be ruled out, but added that, based on his reported symptoms, he had a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia and did not meet the criteria for PTSD at that time.",EvidenceSentence
It was noted that the Veteran warranted further evaluation in the future due to his traumatic stressors as a firefighter and in Vietnam.,EvidenceSentence
None of the other VA mental health records dated in 2010 diagnosed PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"In fact, at a December 2010 VA mental health assessment, the Veteran ""was unable to identify a specific stressor that may account for his 'nervousness' following time in Vietnam.""",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, a September 2011 VA psychological examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under the DSM-IV or any other mental disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"After discussing the Veteran's stressors, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's stressors were not sufficiently traumatic and were not adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD for this particular Veteran.",EvidenceSentence
"Notably, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran also answered in the negative regarding every single criterion for PTSD when specifically queried by the examiner about each and every symptom.",EvidenceSentence
The examination revealed that he did not meet the DSM-IV criterion A through E for PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"In particular, the Veteran did not persistently reexperience his traumatic events from Vietnam; there was no persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness; there were no persistent symptoms of increased arousal; and the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran also did not endorse a single symptom of clinical depression.,EvidenceSentence
This examination also provides strong evidence against the existence of a current PTSD diagnosis attributable to in-service stressors from Vietnam.,ReasoningSentence
"Upon review, in the present case, the Board finds the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).",FindingSentence
"Overall, the November 2010 and September 2011 VA psychological examinations in particular were thorough, supported by an explanation, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.",ReasoningSentence
The VA opinions and treatment records outweigh the private treatment of record on the issue of whether the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV.,ReasoningSentence

"That notwithstanding, in the instant case, the Board has found the Veteran's lay statements are less persuasive than the post-service medical evidence finding that the Veteran does not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.",ReasoningSentence

"Acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD",Sentence
"The Board notes that when a claimant makes a claim, he is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled.",LegalRuleSentence
"As such, the Board has recharacterized the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).",CitationSentence
"While the appellant has filed a claim seeking PTSD, and has submitted a number of documents describing the military's efforts to address psychiatric combat trauma, the appellant has not actually presented any evidence to show that he has actually been diagnosed with PTSD, or even if he has, that it is in anyway related to his military service.",FindingSentence
"The appellant in several of his lengthy statements has suggested that several training exercises for ROTC were stressful, or that he was treated unfairly during service.",EvidenceSentence
He also states studying combat tactics in ROTC classes and participating in training exercises was the same as stressors veterans in combat experience.,EvidenceSentence
"Even if such incidents were stressful to him, a diagnosis of PTSD would need to be based upon such an incident.",EvidenceSentence
"Here, no such diagnosis is present.",EvidenceSentence
"Of note, a number of psychiatric treatment records have been obtained, including from the appellant's psychiatric hospitalization in December 1990 and January 1991, but the records simply do not show that PTSD was ever diagnosed.",EvidenceSentence
"To the extent the appellant believes that he has PTSD from service, he lacks the medical training and expertise to address a complex medical question such as diagnosing a specific psychiatric disability.",ReasoningSentence
"See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).",CitationSentence
"Accordingly, the appellant's claim for PTSD is therefore denied.",FindingSentence
"Turning to the issue of an acquired psychiatric disorder, other than PTSD, it was noted in several service treatment records that the appellant had a history of psychiatric treatment which predated service.",EvidenceSentence
"The appellant has requested that the Board obtain records from this psychiatric treatment at Bayberry Hospital, but the Board concludes that such records could not serve to benefit the appellant.",ReasoningSentence
"See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided).",CitationSentence
The appellant was found to be psychiatrically normal at his physical examination just prior to his ROTC summer camp.,EvidenceSentence
"However, the presumption of soundness does not apply to active duty for training or inactive duty for training.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010).",CitationSentence
"Regardless, even if the appellant was treated prior to his ROTC summer camp, the fact remains that there is no record of any psychiatric manifestations during the 1969 summer camp.",EvidenceSentence
"A previous psychiatric hospitalization might be relevant to the extent that the appellant's period of service from September to December 1970 was active duty, and he would therefore be entitled to the presumption of soundness based on the normal psychiatric profile on his physical examination in October 1970.",LegalRuleSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111.,CitationSentence
"However, the fact that the appellant was treated for depression prior to service would be relevant only if VA needed to rebut the presumption of soundness.",LegalRuleSentence
"This is not required here, as the presumption of soundness applies only when there is manifestation of a disease or injury during service.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012).",CitationSentence
"In this case, the appellant was repeatedly found to be psychiatrically normal on the physical examinations during his active duty service.",EvidenceSentence
"It is true that he reported having experienced nervousness or depression on several medical history surveys, but such notations were clarified by the medical officer to be referring to his hospitalization during college (that is prior to his active service).",EvidenceSentence
"A September 1970 document indicates the hospitalization had occurred three years earlier, again, prior to active duty for training in 1969, and involved a situational depression following his father's death.",EvidenceSentence
"The in-service examinations found the appellant to be psychiatrically normal, and the psychiatric evaluation in September 1970 found he was fit for duty, with no residual psychiatric defects.",EvidenceSentence
"As such, there simply is no in-service manifestation of any psychiatric problem.",FindingSentence
"Thus, without any in-service psychiatric manifestation, the presumption of soundness does not apply.",Sentence
"See Gilbert, supra.",CitationSentence
"Following service, the appellant has been treated for several psychiatric problems.",EvidenceSentence
"However, no psychiatric disability has been shown to have begun during, been aggravated by, or have otherwise been caused by the appellant's brief military service.",FindingSentence
"To this end, the appellant has not specifically identified any medical professional who has made such a connection; and the appellant lacks the training and experience to render such a nexus opinion himself.",ReasoningSentence
"See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).",CitationSentence
"Moreover, the medical evidence of record suggests other causes for the appellant's current psychiatric impairment.",ReasoningSentence
"In October 2010, the appellant underwent a psychological evaluation at which he reported feeling somewhat depressed and frustrated, asserting that he no longer enjoyed activities that he had previously.",EvidenceSentence
The appellant was then hospitalized for two weeks in December 1990 and January 1991 for worsening depression and suicidal ideation.,EvidenceSentence
The discharge summary noted that the appellant had been experiencing increased pain secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 1988.,EvidenceSentence
It was noted that he had been treated in the 60s and 70s for depression and had received some outpatient treatment from 1974-76 following a 1973 motor vehicle accident.,EvidenceSentence
"He was diagnosed with depression, chronic pain, and question of organic mood disorder secondary to brain injury.",EvidenceSentence
"However, there was no mention of the appellant's military service.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, these records suggest a cause for the appellant's psychiatric impairment that is not related to his military service.",ReasoningSentence
"In March 1991, a LCSW (Kurgans) noted that neuropsychological testing supported a finding that the appellant had a brain injury that in all likelihood occurred when he had his accident in April 1988.",EvidenceSentence
"In December 1995, she again noted that the appellant had experienced chronic pain since a motor vehicle accident in 1988, and she suggested that this accident had led to diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and organic brain syndrome.",EvidenceSentence
She noted that the appellant had been seen for psychotherapy since 1990.,EvidenceSentence
The appellant reported to her that he saw parallels between his military and post-military governmental experiences in that in both situations he did not receive sufficient support for his injuries.,EvidenceSentence
The appellant has asserted on several occasions that insufficient consideration was given to this statement.,Sentence
"However, what the appellant appears to be missing is that the LCSW was merely recording his contentions without lending them any medical endorsement; and, as discussed, the service treatment records do not support a finding of any psychiatric impairment during service.",ReasoningSentence
"As such, while this report was considered, it does not suggest that a psychiatric disability is the result of the appellant's active duty or his active duty for training.",ReasoningSentence
The appellant's mother wrote in February 2002 that the appellant had gone to Virginia State College and then served in the U.S. Army.,EvidenceSentence
She asserted that he seemed to have problems dealing with stress since having gone into the service.,EvidenceSentence
"However, this statement does not specifically show the onset of psychiatric symptoms while the appellant was on active duty for training or active duty, or suggest that such service caused an acquired psychiatric disorder to develop.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, like the appellant, his mother may be confused about what constitutes service.",ReasoningSentence
"It is quite understandable that a lay person might perceive either ROTC participation or inactive service while in the Army reserves (as the appellant had from January 1970 until he was separated from the reserves in April 1974) as constituting ""military service.""",ReasoningSentence
"However, as explained above, neither constitutes military service for the purpose of service connection.",ReasoningSentence
"Here, the appellant was clearly hospitalized in college while in the ROTC.",EvidenceSentence
"Likewise, the appellant may have experienced some psychiatric problems while still in the reserves in the wake of his motor vehicle accident in 1971 which caused significant physical limitation.",EvidenceSentence
"However, he was not on either active duty or active duty for training at either time, and therefore any psychiatric manifestations during those times would not warrant service connection.",ReasoningSentence
"As described, to the extent that the appellant currently has an acquired psychiatric disorder, it is not shown that such a condition either began during or was otherwise caused by his military service, or was in any way aggravated by such service.",FindingSentence
"Rather, the appellant is frequently shown to have psychiatric problems as a result of post-service injuries.",FindingSentence
"Thus, the criteria for service connection have not been met, and the appellant's claim is denied.",FindingSentence

The evidence does not show an in-service incurrence of mental health problems.,FindingSentence
Service treatment records from February 1974 note psychiatric problems prior to entering service.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran was given a mental health evaluation prior to acceptance for service.,EvidenceSentence
"A pre-service history was noted, but no current neurosis or psychosis was found.",EvidenceSentence
"Despite the noted history, the Veteran was found fit for duty without any psychiatric disability at the time of entrance into service.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, the presumption of soundness could be for application in this claim as well.",ReasoningSentence

There is no evidence in the Veteran's service records of any treatment or complaints of mental health problems.,EvidenceSentence

FINDING OF FACT,Sentence
The Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD medically linked to an established in-service stressor related to engaging in combat with the enemy.,FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION,Sentence
"The Veteran's claim is based, in part, on his contention that his PTSD resulted from his combat experiences while serving in the Republic of Vietnam.",EvidenceSentence
"For the following reasons, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is established.",FindingSentence
Service connection means that a veteran has a current disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.,LegalRuleSentence

"Service connection is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or ""medical nexus"" between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.",LegalRuleSentence
"Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67; see 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a).",CitationSentence
"Specific to claims for PTSD, service connection generally requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV), a link, established by medical evidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressors, and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors actually occurred.",LegalRuleSentence

See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
"The Board notes that VA examination reports authored by the same clinician in February 2009 and April 2010 reflect the examiner's finding that, although the Veteran reported some symptoms consistent with a PTSD diagnosis, he did not report sufficient symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"However, after weighing the probative value of the VA treatment records and the VA examination reports, the Board finds that the VA examination reports do not outweigh the VA treatment records on the issue of the Veteran's diagnosis of PTSD.",ReasoningSentence
"Essentially, the VA examination reports' findings seem to differ from the VA treatment records' findings with regard to how the Veteran's reported symptoms were evaluated or interpreted.",ReasoningSentence
"In this respect, the VA examiner stated that there was a difference in how the Veteran's avoidance of others while he was shopping was categorized as a symptom.",EvidenceSentence

See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
"Finally, the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect that there is a link between the Veteran's PTSD and the combat related stressor.",ReasoningSentence

The following evidence of record is either favorable or somewhat favorable to the Veteran's PTSD claim:,ReasoningSentence
"In a November 2009 private counselor report, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD, polysubstance dependence, and an impulse control disorder not otherwise specified.",EvidenceSentence
The private counselor indicated that the Veteran appeared confused about the events in his life and appeared to be experiencing flashbacks and intrusive memories associated with his experience in the Navy.,EvidenceSentence
It was noted that those experiences appeared to have been repressed until recently and that the Veteran had recently reached an understanding of how he engaged in self-destructive coping mechanisms throughout his adult life.,EvidenceSentence
"This understanding appeared to have caused a period of crisis due to PTSD, which required further monitoring and treatment.",EvidenceSentence
"Overall, this private report by itself does not provide a basis to grant the claim, as there is no indication testing for PTSD was based in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).",ReasoningSentence
"In April 2013, a private psychologist, J.L., PsyD, after DSM-IV testing, and a review of pertinent records provided by the Veteran, found that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"He demonstrated PTSD symptoms in all four major categories outlined in the DSM-IV TR, (A through D), including presence of traumatic event (two sexual assaults by Navy personnel), re-experiencing, avoidance, and increased arousal.",EvidenceSentence
"In addition, he has associated major depressive episodes.",EvidenceSentence
"However, in making this determination, J.L. acknowledged that, when the Veteran was administered the Trauma Symptoms Inventory test, a self-report measure designed to delineate and gain a better understanding of the symptoms that result from a traumatic experienced, the Veteran's scores were invalid.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran's pattern of answering may be ""somewhat exaggerated and the interpretation should be read with this in mind.""",EvidenceSentence
J.L. added that it was notable that the Veteran's objective assessment measures were notably skewed and the above Trauma Symptoms Inventory test was invalid.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran appeared to be motivated to portray himself in a more negative light, as reflected by his skewed assessment data, according to J.L. Despite his overreporting of symptoms, J.L. still opined that the Veteran had PTSD due to his sexual assaults in-service. J.L. did not identify what led her to make this conclusion, in light of the Veteran's credibility issues and invalid test scores.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran appeared to be motivated to portray himself in a more negative light, as reflected by his skewed assessment data, according to J.L.",EvidenceSentence
"Despite his overreporting of symptoms, J.L. still opined that the Veteran had PTSD due to his sexual assaults in-service.",EvidenceSentence
"J.L. did not identify what led her to make this conclusion, in light of the Veteran's credibility issues and invalid test scores.",EvidenceSentence
"As such, this examination provides some evidence in support of the PTSD claim, but is of limited probative value.",ReasoningSentence
"In addition, a VA psychologist, in a February 2014 VA mental health evaluation, diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD due to military sexual trauma.",EvidenceSentence
She indicated that her evaluation of the Veteran was thorough.,EvidenceSentence
The VA psychologist noted that the Veteran endorsed nightmares three to four times per week with significant physiological response that has been so significant it prompted him going to the hospital.,EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, when discussing the event even briefly, the Veteran was ""notably anxious, hands shaking, voice quivering.""",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran reported very restless sleep, and he stated that it is extremely difficult for him to talk about his trauma and he avoids any crowded places.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran indicated that he attempted to apply for a part-time job and was unable to stay for the interview because there were too many people and he fled the situation.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran also mentioned a lot of difficulty with emotional numbing, feeling cut off from others, and using substances for years to manage his symptoms.",EvidenceSentence
The VA psychologist assessed the Veteran as being very hypervigilant with high startle response.,EvidenceSentence
The VA psychologist concluded the Veteran clearly meets the criteria for PTSD-chronic with depression related to military sexual trauma.,EvidenceSentence
"However, in making this conclusion, the VA psychologist did not review all of the relevant evidence of record in making his determination, including the Veteran's inconsistent denial of PTSD symptoms, denial of in-service sexual trauma in one instance, and previous exaggerated and invalid psychological testing.",ReasoningSentence
"The Court has held that a VA medical examiner's conclusions were of ""questionable probative value"" when the examiner failed to consider certain relevant information.",LegalRuleSentence
"Mariano v. Principi, 17, Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).",CitationSentence
"Thus, this VA psycholoigcal evaluation is entitled to limited probative value in support of the claim.",ReasoningSentence
"The Veteran has also submitted a November 2008 National Center for PTSD factsheet, which stated that men and boys ""who have been sexually assaulted are more likely to suffer from PTSD and other anxiety disorders and depression than those who have never been abused sexually.""",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the Veteran submitted a March 2009 medical treatise article titled ""Coping Strategies Used by Hypersexual Patients to Defend Against the Painful Effects of Shame.""",EvidenceSentence
"The article concluded that, based on studies, hypersexual people are often hiding prior shame or trauma, which can be linked to PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"Although the Court has held that, in general, information contained within medical articles and treatise evidence is too abstract to prove the nexus element of a service-connection claim, the Court has also held that treatises ""can provide important support when combined with an opinion of a medical professional.""",LegalRuleSentence
"Sacks v. West, 11 Vet. App. 314, 316-17 (1998).",CitationSentence
"Furthermore, a medical article or treatise, standing alone, may provide sufficient evidence of a causal connection when it ""discusses generic relationships with a degree of certainty"" so that the causal connection is ""based upon objective facts rather than on an unsubstantiated lay medical opinion.""",LegalRuleSentence
Id. at 317.,CitationSentence
"These medical treatise documents provide some limited evidence in support of the PTSD claim, but they do not provide sufficient corroborating evidence that in-service sexual assaults as alleged by the Veteran actually occurred in his case.",ReasoningSentence
They also do not specifically address the facts of the Veteran's case.,ReasoningSentence
"Conversely, the following evidence of record is unfavorable towards the Veteran's PTSD claim:",ReasoningSentence
"In a May 2005 VA mental health database record, prior to the Veteran filing his claim for VA compensation for PTSD based on sexual assault, the Veteran specifically denied any history of sexual abuse while in the military.",EvidenceSentence
This denial contradicts and is inconsistent with his subsequent detailed allegations regarding alleged in-service sexual abuse.,ReasoningSentence
"See Gardin v. Shinseki, 613 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (the Board acted appropriately in its fact-finding role in its determination that lay statements of record were not credible because they are ""in direct contradiction"" to other evidence of record); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 510-511 (1995) (the Board can use inconsistent statements, among other factors, to impeach the credibility of a witness).",CitationSentence
"In this regard, contemporaneous evidence can have greater probative value than inconsistent testimony provided by the claimant at a later date.",LegalRuleSentence
"Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994).",CitationSentence
"An August 2008 VA psychological examiner noted that the Veteran's reports of memories of abuse is inconsistent - he first says he began having memories of abuse in 2004 while writing his autobiography, but later says memories surfaced during an interview with a nurse at the VA only several months earlier.",EvidenceSentence
"In addition, the Veteran submitted a January 2010 stressor statement that is inconsistent with his numerous other stressor statements.",ReasoningSentence
"In the January 2010 statement, the Veteran remarked that he had been raped and molested ""by maybe 15 Officers and enlisted men by the time of my discharge.""",EvidenceSentence
This statement is wholly inconsistent with the various other stressor statements submitted by the Veteran during the appeal in which he repeatedly only discussed two to three specific instances of sexual abuse.,ReasoningSentence
Such exaggeration places the credibility of the Veteran's assertions in question.,ReasoningSentence
A witness's credibility may be impeached by a showing of interest or bias.,LegalRuleSentence
"See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995).",CitationSentence
The Veteran also submitted a November 2009 buddy statement in email form from an individual who served with the Veteran.,EvidenceSentence
"This individual commented about the Veteran's Navy unit that ""if someone was touchy they got touched until they got over it.""",EvidenceSentence
"However, there was no confirmation of sexual abuse in this statement.",EvidenceSentence
"In fact, the individual noted that he did not remember specific initiations happening as described by the Veteran.",EvidenceSentence
"Rather, the harassment was a way ""of testing to see if you fit and adapted to submarine life and could be trusted to perform when needed.""",EvidenceSentence
"As noted later by the September 2013 VA examiner, this buddy statement was in the context of men being forced to adapt to close quarters.",EvidenceSentence
It does not demonstrate evidence of claimed sexual trauma.,ReasoningSentence
"At a June 2008 VA mental health consultation, the Veteran expressed a primary goal of obtaining documentation so that he might obtain service connection or other benefits as related to negative experiences in the Navy.",EvidenceSentence
He brought an excerpt from his autobiography that he was writing which outlined negative attention (sexualized and otherwise) that he and other seamen had received upon joining the Blue Jackets Choir and the Drum and Bugle Corps in the Navy.,EvidenceSentence
The VA provider determined that the Veteran did not meet any of the criteria for PTSD based on his reported stressors.,EvidenceSentence
The provider also indicated that she was unable to determine the definitive effects of any such military experiences.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran described the related experiences to the VA provider and reported amazement that they had occurred, but he did not characterize them as traumatic.",EvidenceSentence
This VA mental health consultation provides some evidence against the claim.,ReasoningSentence
A November 2008 VA infectious disease note observed that the Veteran's version of military experiences that day was different that those noted in the past.,EvidenceSentence
"The VA provider noted that the Veteran's report of having 22,000 post-service sexual partners, consisting of partners 5 days a week for 35 years with up to 22 partners on a weekend seemed high, and that he appeared ""more interested in compensation"" than in dealing with his problems.",EvidenceSentence
This VA record provides some evidence against the PTSD claim.,ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, a June 2012 VA screen for PTSD was negative.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran denied PTSD symptoms of avoidance, hypervigilance, numbness, or detachment.",EvidenceSentence
"Finally, the RO secured a September 2013 VA psychiatric examination and opinion with regard to the Veteran's PTSD claim.",EvidenceSentence
This report discussed all of the medical and lay evidence of record in detail.,EvidenceSentence
The VA psychiatrist determined that the Veteran did not have a PTSD diagnosis that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria (A through E).,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran denied abuse as a youth.,EvidenceSentence
"He stated that his brother would pick on him, but this was not severe.",EvidenceSentence
He reported that his statements about homosexuality were coerced in the military and that he was instructed not to discuss the alleged rapes.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran also indicated that his anxiety problems and depressive symptoms began in 2005, when he began having panic attacks and temper problems due to co-worker difficulties, and in the context of other post-military stressors.",EvidenceSentence
"The VA psychiatrist noted post-service life stressors, such as physical issues after a recent car accident; the recent death of his mother; the death of his younger brother; the loss of his job in 2005; the death of his father; his HIV treatment; and the loss of his business and partner in 1992.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran described chronic difficulty with depression, anxiety, and insomnia.",EvidenceSentence
The September 2013 VA psychiatrist also concluded that there is no objective evidence in service treatment records of any markers which would support claimed sexual traumas of harassment and physical rape or assault.,EvidenceSentence
"There was no evidence of negative performance reviews, demotions, disciplinary actions, AWOLs, or Article 15s.",EvidenceSentence
There was no evidence of medical visits for physical injury or emotional distress noted in service treatment records.,EvidenceSentence
His claim that his in-service statement about homosexuality was falsified could not be confirmed without resort to speculation.,EvidenceSentence
"Therefore, the claimed stressor was not supported by objective evidence which will fulfill criterion A for PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran's written statement dated in August 1968 in service personnel records regarding homosexuality does not constitute evidence of reduced work performance on duty or any other pathology, as homosexuality in and of itself is not deemed a psychiatric or medical disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"Therefore, the VA psychiatrist determined that the claimed stressor could not be verified or supported by the evidence, and thus does not meet criterion A for PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"In addition, with regard to PTSD criteria B through F, the VA psychiatrist assessed that the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for PTSD in that there was no re-experiencing of the traumatic event, no persistent avoidance of stimuli, and no numbing of general responsiveness.",EvidenceSentence
The fact that he met his long-term partner during service is not indicative of the avoidance criteria that would be expected in the context of traumatic rape in the military.,EvidenceSentence
"Rather, the Veteran's current psychiatric symptomatology was assessed as depressive disorder, NOS, along with a history of polysubstance abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"His cocaine abuse in 2005 was part of a period of post-service excessive stress, his personality disorder, and his lifestyle choices.",EvidenceSentence
He also has a diagnosis of a personality disorder with narcissistic and histrionic traits.,EvidenceSentence
It was noted that the Veteran did well upon discharge from the military and held a job and a long-term love relationship for decades and did not seek out mental health care.,EvidenceSentence
His promiscuity is not a mental health disorder and is not in and of itself evidence of any claimed trauma.,ReasoningSentence
"Upon review, in the present case, the Board finds that the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV) as a result of his alleged sexual assault stressors.",FindingSentence
"Overall, the September 2013 VA psychiatric examination in particular was very thorough, supported by explanations, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.",ReasoningSentence
It also considered the lay and buddy statements of record.,ReasoningSentence
"This VA opinion, supported also by the other evidence listed above, outweighs the findings of the April 2013 private psychological evaluation on the issue of whether the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV from alleged sexual assaults.",ReasoningSentence
"After an extensive interview and psychological testing, the VA examiner provided greater detail in assessing whether the Veteran met each of the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD than any other private or VA provider.",ReasoningSentence
The September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner also pointed out the Veteran's instances of exaggeration and other inaccuracies.,EvidenceSentence

There is no evidence to suggest diagnosable Axis I mental disorder pre-military.,EvidenceSentence

These behaviors in and of themselves are not proof of any formal psychiatric disorder in pre-military; he was not diagnosed or formally treated for any specific psychiatric disorder prior to military.,EvidenceSentence

The following evidence of record is mixed or inconclusive with respect to the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD claim:,ReasoningSentence
"In a June 2008 VA infectious disease note, the Veteran reported his military experiences to his treating physician, who was an infectious disease fellow.",EvidenceSentence
The physician noted that he had told the Veteran it was hard to know what effect the events from the 1960s have on him now.,EvidenceSentence
He was referred to a mental health provider.,EvidenceSentence
"At a June 2008 VA mental health consultation, the Veteran expressed a primary goal of obtaining documentation so that he might obtain service connection or other benefits as related to negative experiences in the Navy.",EvidenceSentence
He brought an excerpt from his autobiography that he was writing which outlined negative attention (sexualized and otherwise) that he and other seamen had received upon joining the Blue Jackets Choir and the Drum and Bugle Corps in the Navy.,EvidenceSentence
The VA provider determined that the Veteran does not meet any of the criteria for PTSD based on his reported stressors.,EvidenceSentence
The provider also indicated that she was unable to determine the definitive effects of any such military experiences.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran described the related experiences to the VA provider and reported amazement that they had occurred, but he did not characterize them as traumatic.",EvidenceSentence
"In a June 2008 statement from Dr. M.W., PhD., it was concluded that the Veteran's military experiences could not be confirmed nor ruled out as a contributing factor in his present depression.",EvidenceSentence
"It was noted that the Veteran was bullied, threatened, traumatized, and sexually harassed by older people who were in positions of power above.",EvidenceSentence
"Dr. M.W. also stated, ""it would be hard to imagine that this treatment he endured has had no effect on him what so ever.""",EvidenceSentence
"During an August 2008 VA psychological examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with depressive disorder and substance abuse in remission.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner stated that he could not resolve the issue of whether that diagnosis was related to the Veteran's military service without resort to mere speculation.,EvidenceSentence
"In so doing, he noted that the Veteran's reports of depression, anger, and difficulty interacting with authority figures were vague and that his memories of abuse were inconsistent.",EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, the Veteran had reported experiencing emotional and physical abuse by his older brother in childhood.",EvidenceSentence

"The VA psychiatrist determined that the Veteran's current diagnosis of depressive disorder NOS was less likely caused by or related to his military experiences, but rather a combination of post-service stressors.",EvidenceSentence
"It was noted that the Veteran was discharged from the military in 1968 and did not report or seek treatment for his anxiety problems and depressive symptoms until many years after service in 2005, when he began having panic attacks and temper problems due to co-worker difficulties, and in the context of other post-military stressors.",EvidenceSentence
"The VA psychiatrist noted post-service life stressors, such as physical issues after a recent car accident; the recent death of his mother; the death of his younger brother; the loss of his job in 2005; the death of his father; his HIV treatment, and the loss of his business and partner in 1992.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran described chronic difficulty with depression, anxiety, and insomnia.",EvidenceSentence
"The September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner reasoned that the Veteran's written statement dated in August 1968 in service personnel records regarding homosexuality does not constitute evidence of reduced work performance on duty or any other pathology, as homosexuality in and of itself is not deemed a psychiatric or medical disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"It was noted the Veteran did well upon discharge from the military and held a job and a long-term love relationship for decades, and he did not seek out mental health care.",EvidenceSentence
His promiscuity is not a mental health disorder and is not in and of itself evidence of any claimed trauma.,EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, the buddy statements submitted by the Veteran's brother and other acquaintances that the Veteran had ""changed"" following his military service are ""vague.""",EvidenceSentence
"In summary, the VA examiner assessed that the Veteran's depression occurred in the context of several post-military life stressors.",EvidenceSentence
The anxiety episodes are infrequent and occurred in the context of post-service cocaine abuse and overlap with his atrial fibrillation symptoms.,EvidenceSentence
"Overall, the September 2013 VA psychiatric examination was thorough, based on a review of the evidence of record, and supported by a detailed rationale.",ReasoningSentence

FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
"1. A psychiatric disorder was not ""noted"" at service entrance.",FindingSentence
2. The Veteran's PTSD did not manifest during her service.,FindingSentence

"4. In-service stressors, sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, have been verified.",FindingSentence
"5. The Veteran's diagnosed PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder did not begin during her military service and are not otherwise related to service, to include as a result of her verified in-service stressor; the evidence similarly fails to establish that an Axis I acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated during her military service.",FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION,Sentence
II. Service Connection,Sentence
The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress and major depressive disorders in September 2006.,Sentence
The Veteran has a fairly complex psychiatric history.,Sentence
Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.,LegalRuleSentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a).",CitationSentence
"Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(d).,CitationSentence
"""To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: ""(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service""-the so-called ""nexus"" requirement.""",LegalRuleSentence
"Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).",CitationSentence
"As an initial point, the psychiatric disorders in this case, to include PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), gender identity disorder (GID), and personality disorder, are not considered to be psychoses (a ""chronic disease"" listed under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309(a)).",Sentence
See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.384.,CitationSentence
"Therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b) do not apply.",Sentence
"Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).",CitationSentence
PTSD,Sentence
The Veteran contends that she was exposed to stressful events during the course of her duties as a photographer in the United States Air Force and that she has PTSD as a result.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran also asserted that she was placed on medical hold shortly after she entered service and testified that not knowing whether she would be able to continue her military service caused her a great deal of stress.,EvidenceSentence
"To establish service connection for PTSD, specifically, the evidence must satisfy three basic elements.",LegalRuleSentence
"There must be 1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; 2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms of PTSD and an in-service stressor; and 3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
"The diagnosis of PTSD must comply with the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM- IV).",LegalRuleSentence
"Id., see also 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a).",CitationSentence
"It is undisputed that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of this appeal, in satisfaction of the first element of service connection.",FindingSentence
"Yet, it is the relationship between service and the current disability, if any, that is at issue here, and it is the delayed onset, typical with PTSD, that complicates the relevant analysis for decision-makers and health care providers alike.",ReasoningSentence
"So, the Board next turns to the occurrence of military stressors.",Sentence
The credible supporting evidence required to establish an in-service stressor depends upon the nature of the stressor.,LegalRuleSentence
"Special provisions allow that the occurrence of a claimed in-service stressor can be shown by certain kinds of credible supporting evidence where the claimed stressor involved personal assault, fear of enemy or terrorist activity, combat, service as a prisoner of war (POW), or diagnosis of PTSD during service.",LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
None of the stressors reported by the Veteran fit into these categories.,ReasoningSentence
"In cases such as this, credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the stressor must be provided by someone other than the Veteran and cannot be provided solely by after the fact medical nexus evidence.",LegalRuleSentence
"See generally Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997).",CitationSentence
"Within the legal framework for evaluating claims of service connection for PTSD, the sufficiency of a stressor is a medical determination, while the occurrence of the stressor is a legal determination.",LegalRuleSentence
"Sizemore v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 264 (2004).",CitationSentence
"The Board finds that the occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events is credibly supported in the record, as her DD-214 documents a military occupational specialty of still photographic specialist.",FindingSentence
"Moreover, she provided a statement from a fellow service photographer, who corroborated that she was responsible for documenting plane crashes, child abuse incidents, and spousal abuse incidents, as well as an occasion when a flight-line Airman was killed when a landing gear tire exploded.",ReasoningSentence
"Therefore, the Board finds that the stressors, as described, are consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's military service.",FindingSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(a).,CitationSentence
The third element specific to service connection for PTSD is met.,FindingSentence
The Board pauses to note that service treatment records show that the Veteran did have a pre-existing ear disorder at the time of service enlistment and that she was placed on medical hold pending a determination as to whether she was fit for worldwide duty assignment.,EvidenceSentence
"Though explicitly noting these facts, in the context of the Veteran's contentions, the VA examiner did not identify the event as a stressor that was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
The Board now turns to the evidence pertaining to a link between the current disability and the Veteran's conceded military stressors.,Sentence
"As a starting point, the Board recognizes that prior decisions have found that the weight of evidence links the present PTSD, diagnosed after service, with the Veteran's childhood traumas prior to service.",ReasoningSentence
A.,Sentence
"Consequently, the Veteran's representative has invoked the presumption of soundness.",Sentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1111, 1132.",CitationSentence
"A veteran is presumed to be in sound condition upon entrance into service, except for defects, infirmities, or disorders noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, or where evidence or medical judgment is such as to warrant a finding that the disease or injury existed before acceptance and enrollment.",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted.,LegalRuleSentence
38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b).,CitationSentence
The Board first must determine whether the presumption of soundness applies.,Sentence
The Board finds that the Veteran was found to be psychiatrically normal at a November 1984 medical examination prior to her entrance into service.,FindingSentence
"As such, notation of a pre-existing disability is not a bar to the application of the presumption of soundness, in this case.",ReasoningSentence
"Ordinarily, where such defects, infirmities, or disorders are not noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service, in order to rebut the presumption of soundness on entry into service.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004); VAOPGCPREC 3-03.",CitationSentence
"However, as a threshold showing before the presumption of soundness may be applied, with its burden shifting provisions, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service actually manifested or was incurred in service.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 52 (2012).",CitationSentence
The Court has cautioned that the presumption of soundness is not a sword for a veteran to fulfill the second element of service connection without any evidence of the manifestation of an in-service disability.,LegalRuleSentence
"Id.; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the presumption of soundness does not ""relieve the veteran of the burden of showing that [he] suffered from a disease or injury while in service""); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2012) (""In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service."").",CitationSentence
"Here, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD manifested during service.",FindingSentence
"The relevant evidence on this question includes a February 2007 VA examination report where the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran suffered PTSD in her youth and that this was ""possibly aggravated"" by service.",EvidenceSentence
"The statement regarding aggravation, without identification of the factual predicate for the conclusion, does not establish manifestation of the disability in service, nor does mere possibility rise to the requisite ""at least as likely as not"" threshold.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993).",CitationSentence
"Of note, the examiner gave no explanation as to how aggravation was felt to have occurred, as no baseline level of severity of psychiatric impairment was identified.",EvidenceSentence
"Owing to the unique character of mental health illness, and attendant complexity of neurological and psychological pathology, the Court has acknowledged delayed-onset PTSD.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (""'Because of the complexity of PTSD. . .PTSD can occur hours, months, or years after a military stressor.'"").",CitationSentence
A retrospective review of the record may well allow a mental healthcare provider to conclude that earlier events caused or aggravated subsequently diagnosed PTSD.,ReasoningSentence
"Even so, that is not the case here.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, such a conclusion need not necessarily be based on contemporaneous symptoms but, instead, on clinical expertise, informed by developments over a veteran's lifetime.",ReasoningSentence
"Consequently, as the possible aggravation was not associated with contemporaneous manifestation, the Board affords this statement little, if any, weight in its final resolution of the instant matter.",ReasoningSentence
"In fact, VA examiners, in applying clinical judgment to the record, have consistently declined to draw the conclusion and the Veteran has not shown-to the at least as likely as not standard-that her PTSD manifested in service.",FindingSentence
"As a VA examiner in June 2013 explained, after a comprehensive review of the record and recitation of pertinent facts, the service treatment records repeatedly rule out diagnosis of any psychiatric disability.",ReasoningSentence
"As detailed in the Board's now vacated decisions, the record shows that the Veteran was evaluated during service by psychiatric services.",EvidenceSentence
She was first evaluated by the Chaplin/Family Advocacy Officer at a mental health services clinic in December 1985.,EvidenceSentence
"Mental status examination at that time was within normal limits, and the medical officer indicated that no diagnosis was warranted.",EvidenceSentence
"Subsequent entries in January and March 1986, showed that her records were screened for reassignment by mental health services, but again there was no indication of any mental health problems.",EvidenceSentence
She was again found to be medically eligible for retention in March 1986.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was also seen by psychiatric services in June 1990, shortly before separation, with the notation of no diagnosis in the record.",EvidenceSentence
"Likewise, the Veteran was found psychiatrically normal in the Report of Medical Examination at separation in July 1990.",EvidenceSentence
"Furthermore, there is no evidence of symptoms attributed at the time, or in retrospect by a health care provider, to PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"Other than a single entry in June 1990, shortly before her discharge from service, the service treatment records showed no complaints or abnormalities related to any psychiatric problems during service.",EvidenceSentence
"Regarding the June 1990 entry, the service records show that the Veteran was seen by psychiatric services for stress and for evaluation of extreme gullibility and low self-esteem.",EvidenceSentence
"No specific findings were reported and, again, the diagnosis on Axis I was no diagnosis.",EvidenceSentence
"At the April 2011 Travel Board hearing, the Veteran submitted a letter from a fellow soldier who recalled a time when the Veteran was sad and distant.",EvidenceSentence
"Yet, on a July 1990 Report of Medical History at separation from service, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran also acknowledged in her February 2007 VA examination and April 2011 Travel Board hearing that she did not have any psychiatric problems during service and she denied seeking any psychiatric treatment, including at the time of discharge from service.",EvidenceSentence
"As such, there is no showing that the Veteran had PTSD or symptoms attributable to PTSD, during service.",FindingSentence
"As an alternative to diagnosis or obvious symptoms of PTSD in service, the Veteran pointed to a number of outbursts and behavioral problems in service, purportedly indicative of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"However, the Board recognizes that not every deficiency or failure to succeed is the hallmark of mental health illness.",ReasoningSentence
"To the extent that a clinical diagnosis is warranted, such a determination is, again, soundly within the purview of a mental healthcare provider.",ReasoningSentence
"A review of her Airman Performance Reports showed that in her first year of service (September 1985 to September 1986), the Veteran received an overall rating of 7 by her supervisor (on a scale of zero to nine).",EvidenceSentence
"The evaluation report indicated that the Veteran had progressed at a slow but satisfactory rate, that she needed constant supervision, and that she lacked the ability to grasp both the practical and technical aspects of her job.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to E-3 by her commanding officer in December 1986, based on her supervisor's recommendation that she was not progressing in a satisfactory manner and did not pay attention to detail.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran's next two annual performance evaluations (1986 to 1987 and 1987 to 1988) showed marked improvement in her duty performance and attitude, and she was given an overall score on nine on both reports.",EvidenceSentence
"However, her evaluations from September 1988 to September 1989, and September 1989 to March 1990, showed that her quality of work steadily deteriorated and was inconsistent and unpredictable.",ReasoningSentence
"She was counseled numerous times on the condition both of her dormitory room and of her uniform and on her personal hygiene, with little or no improvement.",EvidenceSentence
"She had angry outbursts at work and in the dormitory which alienated the Veteran from her peers, and despite financial counseling regarding several overdue accounts at various local businesses, she continued to spend to excess.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to sergeant in October 1989 but was subsequently recommended and promoted to E-5 in February 1990.,EvidenceSentence
"However, in July 1990, the Veteran's commanding officer recommended that the Veteran's appointment (promotion) be vacated.",EvidenceSentence
"In a letter to her senior rating supervisor (Command Sergeant Major) dated in July 1990, the Veteran wrote that she realized that she had not performed as well as she could have in the past six months because of serious financial and personal problems, but that she believed that she had finally straightened things out and wanted to continue her military career.",EvidenceSentence
"The service records showed that the Veteran was AWOL on the day she was seen at the mental health clinic in June 1990 and that she subsequently received nonjudicial punishment (Article 15) for her actions, which included punching a hole in a wall.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was given a general discharge from service in August 1990, based on a pattern of misconduct during service that, in addition to her Article 15, included dereliction of duty, writing a bad check, and failing a dormitory inspection.",EvidenceSentence
"To the extent that the Veteran has now alleged that she did experience psychiatric problems-however manifest-during service, the Board finds that she lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of PTSD.",ReasoningSentence
"See Young, 766 F.3d at 1353 (""PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence, standing alone, is competent and sufficient to identify.",CitationSentence
"'Because of the complexity of PTSD, the application of careful clinical judgment is necessary to identify and describe the relationship between past events and current symptoms.'"").",Sentence
"In June 2013, the VA examiner reviewed the records showing that the Veteran had a repeated pattern of misconduct during military service.",EvidenceSentence
"Critically, she indicated that the pattern was a result of her diagnosed personality disorder and was not associated with her later diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner explained that the Veteran's service treatment records did not show any mention of symptoms of anxiety as a result of her stressful experiences as a photographer, and there was nothing to associate her misconduct with the photography.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the examiner noted that the Veteran's performance difficulties occurred as early as 1986, not long after she entered the military.",EvidenceSentence
The Board finds this compelling opinion and rationale most probative of the issue regarding the absence of manifest PTSD in service.,ReasoningSentence
"As was explained, absent a finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service, the presumption of soundness is not for application.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 54.",CitationSentence
"Of note, in Gilbert, as here, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability post-service, but the diagnosis was not rendered during service and there was no indication that the disability had onset or was present during service.",ReasoningSentence
"In Gilbert, the Veteran complained of several incidents in service which he believed caused his psychiatric disability.",ReasoningSentence
"However, the Court explained that in such a circumstance, the presumption of soundness did not attach.",ReasoningSentence
"As such, even though the Veteran has, since service, identified in-service stressors which could support a PTSD diagnosis, the evidence does not show an in-service manifestation of PTSD.",FindingSentence
"Simple concession of a military stressor does not constitute manifestation of disease, as that is only one of many criteria that must combine into a diagnosis of PTSD.",ReasoningSentence
"Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application in this case.",FindingSentence
B.,Sentence
"The analysis does not stop there, as it must now be determined whether the evidence of record makes it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD-though not manifest during-was nonetheless either caused or aggravated by her military service.",Sentence
"As noted above, the occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events are credibly supported in the record.",FindingSentence
"Moreover, a VA examiner in June 2013 acknowledged that the Veteran's photographing of horrific and traumatic sights in the military was adequate to support criterion A of a PTSD diagnosis.",EvidenceSentence
"However, the question still remains whether the Veteran's later-diagnosed PTSD is the result of an in-service stressor.",Sentence
"Weighing against the Veteran's claim are service treatment records which are absent for any diagnosis for PTSD, as previously detailed.",ReasoningSentence
"Although the Veteran pointed to a number of outbursts and problems in service, the medical evidence of record does not actually show that associated PTSD was ever diagnosed, despite the fact that these behavioral problems were well-known.",ReasoningSentence
The Board also appreciates that the Veteran did not seek mental health treatment and was not diagnosed with PTSD for more than a decade after service.,ReasoningSentence
These post-service treatment records weigh against a finding of a link between the currently diagnosed PTSD and the in-service stressor events.,ReasoningSentence
"The Veteran reported first initiating contact with a mental health professional in June 2002, at which time she related that she had been depressed since February 2002 when she left her wife to be involved in an ""alternative lifestyle.""",EvidenceSentence
She also detailed abuse suffered as a child.,EvidenceSentence
She did not follow-up with treatment until May 2005 when she was hospitalized at the Tucson VA due to depression.,EvidenceSentence
"She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and the focus of treatment was exclusively on the Veteran's former spouse, from which she was estranged over the preceding three years, and on her traumatic childhood.",EvidenceSentence
"A VA psychiatric note the second day of admission showed that the Veteran had several other stressors, including financial concerns.",EvidenceSentence
"Other than reporting her period of military service, the Veteran made no mention of any problems related to service.",EvidenceSentence
"In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran presented with impaired sleep and concentration, depression, nightmares, and anger.",EvidenceSentence
Nightmares involved children being beaten and her father harming her sister.,EvidenceSentence
"She also reported recurrent intrusive thoughts about the death of her fiancÃ©e in a 1997 automobile accident, which she witnessed.",EvidenceSentence
She mentioned taking photos of women and children who were beaten or raped (including an image of 4-year-old boy in particular).,EvidenceSentence
This treatment encounter resulted is the first diagnosis of PTSD in the record; no specific etiology was noted.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran was seen at a private medical facility in December 2006.,EvidenceSentence
"There, she reported that her emotional problems dated back to her childhood and were related to her physically abusive father.",EvidenceSentence
"She again reported the events involving her sister, endorsing bouts of depression and nightmares ever since the incident.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD, delayed-onset, and MDD, without psychosis.",EvidenceSentence
"Social Security Administration records contain a Functional Capacity Evaluation (mental) dated February 2007, which showed a diagnosis of PTSD secondary to childhood and military trauma and of co-morbid dysthymic disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The assessment does not identify the nature of the military stressor and provides no rationale or analysis of the PTSD criteria.,EvidenceSentence
"See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (explaining that ""most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning."").",CitationSentence
"The Board affords little probative value to this conclusory piece of evidence, in light of the record as a whole.",ReasoningSentence
"The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in February 2007, to assist in determining the nature and etiology of her psychiatric disorders.",EvidenceSentence
The VA examiner reviewed the claims file and performed a mental status examination.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran reported that she had one psychiatric session when she was about ten years old because of temper tantrums and said that she was abused physically, mentally, and emotionally as a child, but was uncertain regarding sexual abuse.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran denied any psychiatric treatment in service.,EvidenceSentence
"She described a number of incidents in service when she photographed gruesome scenes, the most troubling of which involved a child who had been physically abused.",EvidenceSentence
She said that this reminded her of when she was abused as a child.,EvidenceSentence
"On mental status examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran showed a full range of affect and there were no signs of any mood disorder or sadness.",EvidenceSentence
"She had excellent eye contact, articulated her speech in a goal directed manner and was fully animated, coming to the exam with her notes organized.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner noted that the Veteran's speech was dramatic and at times, embellished in detail, and that she was quick to endorse items, apparently trying to make herself look more disturbed than she was.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran was alert and well-oriented with no indication of any short- or long-term memory or cognitive impairment.,EvidenceSentence
"He noted that the Veteran's memory seemed somewhat selective and that while she had a vague memory of some of the incidents from her youth, it could also be a pattern of her communication or possibly due to amnesic episodes to dissociative disorder; all of which could be consistent with PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"The examiner ultimately diagnosed PTSD, at least as likely as not from childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"Thereafter, she continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which predominantly related to her childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"When seen by VA for individual counseling in July 2007, the Veteran reported that when she heard a child crying, it reminded her of when she was a photographer in the service and had to take a picture of an abused child for court documentation.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran said the she was physically, sexually, and verbally abused as a child and felt this was part of her PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
She also said that she would like to continue doing photography but did not have the finances.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran thought that she had PTSD because she is constantly worried about life in general, was irritable and angry, and has flashbacks from her childhood, nightmares, and difficulty sleeping.",EvidenceSentence
"In his assessment, the psychiatrist commented that the Veteran had vague symptoms of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"He noted that while the Veteran reported recurrent thoughts of her childhood and associated nightmares, she never mentioned any avoidant behavior, isolation, re-experiencing, or feelings of detachment, generally associated with PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"Ultimately, though documenting the Veteran's express opinion regarding a positive link between PTSD and service, the provider, after clinical assessment, concluded any such diagnosis would be associated with childhood trauma.",EvidenceSentence
"When seen in September 2007, the Veteran reported that she was under a lot of stress but felt that she was doing better, and she believed that her depression and anxiety would improve once she began the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) process.",EvidenceSentence
"In November 2007, she said that she had vivid flashbacks of personal childhood abuse over and over daily.",EvidenceSentence
"When seen in August 2008, the Veteran reported improvement since moving out of a shelter and into her own residence.",EvidenceSentence
"In January and February 2009, the Veteran reported that she was sleeping better and that her nightmares had decreased to one- to-two per week with her medication.",EvidenceSentence
"When seen in January 2010, the Veteran reported feeling ""pretty good"" and that her nightmares were minimal.",EvidenceSentence
"The assessment at that time was gender identity disorder, with questionable history of sub-syndromal PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"When seen in April 2010, the VA psychiatrist noted that the Veteran took Prazosin on occasion for her nightmares, the context of which were relatively vague.",EvidenceSentence
"The psychiatrist indicated that she was unable to definitely establish a diagnosis of PTSD, though she noted that the Veteran did report symptoms of irritability and nightmares related to early childhood events.",EvidenceSentence
"When seen by VA in September 2010, the Veteran reported disturbing nightmares, but said that her depressive symptoms had improved significantly since getting in contact with her sister.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran reported nightmares every other night involving a motor vehicle accident and of a friend being decapitated.,EvidenceSentence
"She talked about her service days, including the time that she took a picture of an airman who had been decapitated.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner indicated that the Veteran had a history of questionable sub-syndromal PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"The diagnosis was mood disorder, NOS.",EvidenceSentence
"Pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, a VA medical opinion was obtained in June 2013.",EvidenceSentence
"As noted, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's verified in-service stressors could support a diagnosis of PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
"However, she found that in the case of this particular Veteran, the events she experienced in the military, although upsetting and stressful, did not appear to be medically sufficient to cause all or part of her particular PTSD.",EvidenceSentence
This assessment is relatively consistent with the VA treatment records detailed above.,ReasoningSentence
"The examiner observed that as had been stated by both the Veteran and her treatment providers, the Veteran's PTSD and its expressed symptoms primarily pertained to her severe childhood abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the examiner found that the content of the Veteran's re-experiencing symptoms was predominately related to childhood traumas, and there were no avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms described in treatment notes or other documentation that would be relatable to these traumatic events in the military.",EvidenceSentence
"The VA examiner also observed that more recently, the Veteran had discussed the 1997 car accident in which her fiancÃ©e died.",EvidenceSentence
"In recent treatment, she cited this as the most traumatic event she had experienced.",EvidenceSentence
She also discontinued treatment because discussing this event was triggering memories and anxiety about childhood abuse.,EvidenceSentence
"In September 2013, the Veteran's representative argued that the VA examiner had erred by stating that the records do not demonstrate a military stressor that would account for the majority of the symptoms presentation, or that this constituted the bulk of treatment focus, in that the examiner appeared to conclude that it was an all or nothing debate.",Sentence
"The representative suggested that under the liberal at least as likely as not standard there is no need to demonstrate that a ""bulk"" of the problem or a ""majority"" of the treatment focused only on the service stressors.",Sentence
The representative acknowledged that the Veteran had readily stated that her childhood trauma was aggravated by the military stressors.,Sentence
"Yet, the representative suggested that the VA examiner had failed to discuss the aspect of the conceded trauma dealing with the documentation of child abuse victims during service and whether this one aspect of the military stressor more than any other could have resurfaced the Veteran's childhood traumas-even now hidden amongst the discussion of her own childhood traumas.",Sentence
The Board has considered this argument and concurs that an in-service stressor need not be the predominant (that is bulk or majority) cause of PTSD.,Sentence
"Although the examiner found that the witnessing of traumatic events, such as the ones photographed by the Veteran during service, would be sufficient to establish Criterion A, the examiner explained that in the Veteran's case, the evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran met Criterion B (symptoms of reexperiencing) or C and D (symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal) under the DSM-IV for PTSD as a result of the in-service experiences.",EvidenceSentence
"The VA examiner explained that the symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that the Veteran experienced, and which formed the basis of her PTSD diagnosis, were associated with childhood abuse and her fiancÃ©e's death in 1997-not with the Veteran's experiences in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, although the representative had suggested that the examiner failed to use the ""at least as likely as not standard,"" the June 2013 VA examination report directly contradicts this assertion as the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's PTSD was ""less likely than not"" incurred in or caused by the confirmed in-service stressors.",ReasoningSentence
The Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.,ReasoningSentence
"While the Veteran is competent to provide evidence concerning her observations and experiences, any such assertions must be weighed against other evidence of record, including her inconsistent and contradictory statements.",LegalRuleSentence
"See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).",CitationSentence
"""Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.""",LegalRuleSentence
"Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007).",CitationSentence
"While competency is a legal determination, credibility ""is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.""",LegalRuleSentence
"Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994) (citing Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991)).",CitationSentence
The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her currently diagnosed PTSD to her verified in-service stressor event.,ReasoningSentence
"Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other lay and medical evidence of record.",ReasoningSentence
"Credibility can be generally evaluated by a showing of interest, bias or inconsistent statements; and the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness testimony are also factors that may be considered.",LegalRuleSentence
"Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 510-511 (1995).",CitationSentence
The Board emphasizes that the Court has recognized that personal interest to receive benefits may affect the credibility of the evidence.,LegalRuleSentence
"Cartright, 2 Vet. App. at 25 (1991).",CitationSentence
"In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran has made numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements regarding the nature, extent, and severity of her psychiatric symptoms during the pendency of this appeal, revising her statements in an attempt to associate her current psychiatric problems to her time in service.",ReasoningSentence
"For example, at her Board hearing the Veteran testified that she never sought psychiatric counseling in service because she did not think that she had any problems.",EvidenceSentence
"Yet, in a conflicting statement, she also stated that she did not seek treatment in service because she would have lost her security clearance.",ReasoningSentence
She again endorsed first realizing that there was something wrong in approximately 2002.,EvidenceSentence
"After doing some research, she realized that she had all the symptoms described for PTSD, including hypervigilance and panic attacks.",EvidenceSentence
"However, after a meticulous review of all of the medical treatment records of record, the Board has not found a single complaint or report of hypervigilance or panic attacks.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, the March 2012 JMR failed to identify any such symptoms.",EvidenceSentence
"Similarly, while the Veteran testified that she had vivid, recurring nightmares, and flashbacks related specifically to her experiences in service four-to-five times per week, she did not describe any such symptoms related to service when examined by VA in 2007.",EvidenceSentence
"Most of the treatment records indicated that she gave a ""vague"" description of her nightmares and flashbacks.",EvidenceSentence
"On the few occasions when she did describe her nightmares and flashbacks, the Veteran reported that they were about the abuse she suffered and witnessed as a child and the death of her fiancÃ©e.",EvidenceSentence
"Furthermore, although the Veteran was treated for psychiatric problems on numerous occasions since May 2005, as described above, she never mentioned any symptoms or problems related to her service experiences as a photographer until one and a half years later (see November 2006 treatment note), coincident with her September 2006 claim for same.",EvidenceSentence
"Even during July 2007 treatment, the Veteran did not relate her current psychiatric problems to any incident in service and said only that when she heard a child cry, it reminded her of the child she photographed in service, who had been abused.",EvidenceSentence
She consistently reported being physically and emotionally abused as a child and believed that this was part of her PTSD.,ReasoningSentence
"The fact that the Veteran would recognize that she had PTSD or some symptoms of PTSD in 2002, which she believed to be related to service, but did not report any such symptoms as being related to service until some four years later, and 18 months after documented psychiatric treatment-instead detailing prior and subsequent unrelated stressors-strains credibility.",ReasoningSentence
"Even looking at the Veteran's efforts at VA examinations, it was noted at the February 2007 VA examination that the Veteran was quick to endorse items, apparently trying to make herself look more disturbed than she was, thereby suggesting a willingness to inaccurately discuss her medical symptomatology.",ReasoningSentence
The Board now turns to aggravation of PTSD by military stressors.,Sentence
"As previously indicated, the February 2007 VA examination resulted in the possibility of aggravation-too equivocal to establish the requisite nexus.",ReasoningSentence
"Nevertheless, because this examination had allowed for the possibility that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability had been aggravated by her military service, the Board, as directed by the July 2014 JMR, obtained a medical opinion to investigation the possibility of this association.",Sentence
In November 2014 the same examiner who completed the June 2013 examination addressed the question of whether the Veteran's military experiences aggravated his childhood based PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"After fully reviewing the evidence of record, the examiner concluded that an opinion regarding aggravation of PTSD based on the impact of conceded traumas in service could not be rendered without resort to mere speculation.",EvidenceSentence
She explained that without documentation of any medical disorder or associated symptoms at any time prior to military service-symptoms which the Veteran herself denied appreciating even through her military service-there is no way to specify if traumatic memories of the military experiences were associated with a permanent worsening of the Veteran's PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner also noted that there was no baseline level of functioning found in the available medical evidence, upon which to base a conclusion that a condition had been aggravated.",EvidenceSentence
"As explained by the examiner, the record does not provide a basis upon which to render a principled assessment regarding aggravation.",ReasoningSentence
A medical opinion cannot be compelled where a health care provider has specifically identified the information necessary to render a clinical determination and has yet deemed the available information insufficient-or entirely absent.,ReasoningSentence
Neither the Veteran nor the record identifies or suggests any source of relevant evidence that might aid in a determination.,ReasoningSentence
The Board appreciates the complexity of such a determination on the sparsity of the available record and fully credits the VA examiner's explanation.,ReasoningSentence
"See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 391 (2010) (stating a VA medical examination is not inadequate merely because the medical examiner states he or she cannot reach a conclusion without resort to speculation and the duty to assist does not extend to requiring a VA physician to render an opinion beyond what may reasonably be concluded from the procurable medical evidence).",CitationSentence
"As such, the examiner's conclusion is fully adequate and is not rendered inadequate solely on the grounds that the examiner stated that she could not form an opinion without resorting to speculation.",ReasoningSentence
"For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the Veteran's alleged symptoms regarding her service experiences are self-serving and are not credible.",ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, after taking into account the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology, the June 2013 VA examiner offered a highly probative medical opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was due to her childhood abuse and death of her fiancÃ©e.",ReasoningSentence
"Additionally, while the Veteran was treated by several other psychiatrists over the years, most of those reports indicate that her current psychiatric problems were related to her childhood abuse.",ReasoningSentence
"The Board has considered whether the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's PTSD was aggravated by her in-service experiences, but finds that there is not sufficient evidence to meet the relative equipoise standard.",FindingSentence
"That is, the absence of evidence to the contrary does not render it at least as likely as not that a psychiatric disability was aggravated, particularly when, as here, the is overwhelming evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric disability is attributable to non-service related situations.",ReasoningSentence
"In conclusion, the preponderance of evidence establishes that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD years after service, based on pre- and post-service stressors, with no manifestation of PTSD during service.",FindingSentence
"Consequently, the burden of proof, by any degree, has not been shifted to VA.",ReasoningSentence
"Second, while the Veteran's duties as a photographer in service have been found to meet a single criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD, the remaining criteria have not been found by mental health professionals to be so met, in relation specifically to any military stressor.",ReasoningSentence
"As such, there is no supported and significantly probative evidence of diagnosed PTSD directly caused by the Veteran's active service.",FindingSentence
"Last, pursuant to the July 2014 JMR, VA most recently sought an opinion as to whether military service yet aggravated the Veteran's PTSD, in light of suggested possibility.",Sentence
"While the burden of proof remains on the Veteran to at least balance the evidence for and against her claim, the VA examiner's reasoned opinion that the issue of aggravation cannot be resolved without resort to mere speculation provides no weight or counterweight at all, as the absence of evidence does not move the evidentiary scales.",ReasoningSentence
There is no credible and probative medical evidence to establish that military service aggravated PTSD diagnosed fifteen years later.,FindingSentence
"Based on the evidence of record, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of relationship between the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD and her corroborated in-service stressor events.",FindingSentence
"Accordingly, the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, and the claim must be denied.",FindingSentence
Other Acquired Psychiatric Disorders,Sentence
"The evidence of record demonstrates that, in addition to PTSD, the Veteran has also been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders during the pendency of this appeal, to include: major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.",FindingSentence
"However, the totality of the competent medical evidence does not show that these conditions began during or were otherwise caused by the Veteran's military service.",FindingSentence
"As noted in the previous section, there is no indication that the Veteran had any psychiatric problems either in service or for more than a decade after service.",FindingSentence
"When first seeking treatment in June 2002, tellingly, the Veteran did not relate her depression to service but, instead, stated that it began when she left her wife to be involved in an alternative lifestyle.",ReasoningSentence
"The Veteran did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005, when she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily related to her ex-wife.",EvidenceSentence
"Again, the Veteran filed a claim for VA disability benefits in September 2006.",EvidenceSentence
"In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported the death of her fiancÃ© in 1997 and mentioned in-service photos of disturbing images.",EvidenceSentence
"At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, nightmares, and anger, which she was said began at age ten.",EvidenceSentence
"During private psychiatric assessment in December 2006, the Veteran reported that she had felt depressed since 1986, when she was placed on medical administrative hold pending evaluation of a pre-existing ear disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, with no comment regarding origin.",EvidenceSentence
"At the April 2011 Travel Board hearing, the Veteran submitted a letter from a fellow soldier who recalled a time when the Veteran was sad and distant.",EvidenceSentence
"However, as noted in the previous section, a psychiatric disorder was not noted at service entrance and service treatment records are negative for any diagnoses or treatment for major depressive disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"In the Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.",EvidenceSentence
The board finds the contemporaneous record more probative than the statement twenty years later.,ReasoningSentence
"See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (noting that contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than history as reported by a veteran).",CitationSentence
"During January 2007 VA treatment, she reported struggling with her sexual identity since childhood, since seven or eight years old.",EvidenceSentence
The Board finds that VA treatment notes of record document an extensive and complex mental health history.,ReasoningSentence
"However, they do not provide a medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's depression.",EvidenceSentence
"In efforts to obtain a medical opinion on the question of whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorders were etiologically related to service, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2007.",EvidenceSentence
"Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner, in pertinent part, diagnosed: gender identity disorder; depressive disorder, not otherwise specified (in full remission); and personality disorder with histrionic and narcissistic traits.",EvidenceSentence
The VA examiner opined that none of these psychiatric disorders were related to service.,EvidenceSentence
"In support of this opinion, the February 2007 VA examiner reasoned that there was no evidence during the examination that the Veteran was suffering from depression.",EvidenceSentence
"According to the examiner, the suicidal note that the Veteran gave to a counselor in August of 2006 was for attention seeking behavior, as the Veteran had a pattern of behavior that would be inferred as narcissistic and/or histrionic.",EvidenceSentence
"It was noted that, since her youth, the Veteran seemed to have had a pattern of seeking attention suggesting a character or personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner further noted that the Veteran also appeared to be troubled about gender issues.,EvidenceSentence
"The Board finds the February 2007 VA medical opinion, which is uncontroverted in the record, highly probative of the nexus element for service connection of an acquired psychiatric disorder.",ReasoningSentence
"In a subsequent June 2013 VA examination report, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran, in pertinent part, with personality disorder and gender identity disorder, which were found to be unrelated to events in service.",EvidenceSentence
"Although it was noted that the Veteran continued to meet the criteria for a personality disorder diagnosis due to a pervasive pattern of interpersonal problems, inability to conform to some social norms, and limited adaptability to stressful environments, the personality disorder was found to be rooted in severe childhood abuse and not service.",EvidenceSentence
No other mental health illness was diagnosed (i.e. depressive disorder).,EvidenceSentence
The examiner opined that the psychiatric disorders were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the service.,EvidenceSentence
"As previously noted, the Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.",ReasoningSentence
The Board has considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her psychiatric disorders to service.,ReasoningSentence
"However, for the reasons discussed in detail in the previous section, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other evidence of record.",ReasoningSentence

B. Discussion,Sentence
"In the present case, the Board must find that the evidence of record is in relative equipoise in establishing that the Veteran's current psychiatric condition likely manifested during service.",Sentence
The reasons are as follows.,Sentence
1. Existence of a Present Disability,Sentence
The Veteran has been diagnosed with multiple psychiatric disorders.,EvidenceSentence
"Most recently, a VA clinical psychologist made a diagnosis in June 2011 of ""schizoaffective and PTSD features (Childhood and MST).""",EvidenceSentence
The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was confirmed on VA examination in July 2010.,EvidenceSentence
A private psychological evaluation in December 2002 resulted in a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.,EvidenceSentence
"Other diagnoses include Bipolar II disorder, Recurrent; PTSD; Borderline Personality disorder (September 2001) and depressive disorder, NOS; impulse control disorder, NOD; rule out borderline and histrionic personality disorder (July 2001).",EvidenceSentence
"(The Board notes that personality disorders are not diseases or injuries within the meaning of applicable legislation and, therefore, cannot themselves be service-connected.",LegalRuleSentence
"See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(c); O'Bryan v. McDonald, 771 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2014).",CitationSentence
They are listed here for sake of completeness.),Sentence
A diagnosis of PTSD was made during the September 2001 and December 2002 evaluations.,EvidenceSentence
"The diagnosis of ""PTSD features"" was made more recently at VA in June 2011.",EvidenceSentence
"For purposes of this appeal, there is no compelling indication that the earlier diagnoses of PTSD were incorrect or that the Veteran's PTSD had resolved by the time he filed his claim in September 2009.",ReasoningSentence
"See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 153 (1997).",CitationSentence
"As such, the first requirement to establish service connection, evidence of a current disability, has been met as to this claim.",FindingSentence
"See Walker, 708 F.3d at 1337.",CitationSentence
2. In-Service Incurrence of Injury or Disease,Sentence
"Next, the evidence of record makes at least equally likely that the Veteran manifested symptoms of his condition during service.",FindingSentence
"His service treatment records (STRs) affirmatively show treatment in December 1983 for ""[m]ild depression"" associated with his expectation that his father would ""die [at] any time [and he] worries about this.""",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran has also alleged MST during service.,EvidenceSentence
"The RO determined in an October 2010 statement of the case (SOC) that the Veteran likely experienced MST, as he claimed.",EvidenceSentence
"The RO's finding does not follow from the evidence it cited, and its finding is not a binding determination at this point in time.",ReasoningSentence
"See Anderson v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 423, 428 (2009).",CitationSentence
"The RO based its finding on an entry in the STRs showing that the Veteran received treatment at Fort Hood, Texas, in May 1985 for lesions on the penis with last sexual contact one week prior.",EvidenceSentence
"The Board notes that this treatment was received two years after the last claimed trauma (the second of two), which the Veteran states occurred in 1983.",ReasoningSentence
"Thus, this treatment could not possibly have been for the alleged 1983 trauma, which would have occurred outside the one-week window identified in the treatment record.",ReasoningSentence
"Also, the treatment occurred in Texas, rather than Germany, and he had transferred out of Germany in August 1983, which would again place it outside of the one-week timeframe.",ReasoningSentence
"Nonetheless, the December 1983 treatment for depression establishes (a) treatment for a mental health condition during service (depression), and (b) a stressful event (the impending death of his father).",ReasoningSentence
There is some indication in the evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric condition may have manifested prior to service.,ReasoningSentence
"As best summarized by a VA examiner in September 2011, the Veteran has reported at various times that he experienced traumatic events as a child.",EvidenceSentence
"For purposes of this appeal, a mental health condition was not ""noted"" at service entrance.",FindingSentence
"On physical examination at entrance in May 1981, a psychiatric evaluation was ""normal,"" and no psychiatric abnormality is otherwise noted on the Report of Medical History or Report of Medical examination.",EvidenceSentence
"It was noted that the Veteran affirmatively ""denies history of drug and alcohol abuse[.]""",EvidenceSentence
"A veteran is presumed to have been sound upon entry into the military, except as to conditions noted at the time of the acceptance, examination, or enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the condition existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.",LegalRuleSentence
"38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111 (West 2014); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).",CitationSentence
"The presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service.",LegalRuleSentence
"Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012), aff'd 749 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2014).",CitationSentence
"Once the presumption of soundness applies, the burden of proof shifts to and remains with VA to prove both preexistence and the absence of aggravation by clear and unmistakable evidence.",LegalRuleSentence
"Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231 (2012).",CitationSentence
"A ""claimant need not produce any evidence of aggravation in order to prevail under the aggravation prong,"" even if clear and unmistakable evidence establishes that a disease preexisted service.",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"In other words, the ""burden is not on the claimant to show that his disability increased in severity.""",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"To the contrary, the burden is on VA to ""establish by clear and unmistakable evidence that [a preexisting disease] did not [increase in severity during service] or that any increase was due to the natural progress of the disease.""",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"This burden must be met by ""affirmative evidence"" demonstrating that there was no aggravation.",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"The burden is not met by finding ""that the record contains insufficient evidence of aggravation.""",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
The presumption of soundness relates to the second requirement-the showing of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury.,LegalRuleSentence
"In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service.",LegalRuleSentence
"Thereafter, except for conditions noted at induction, the presumption of soundness ordinarily operates to satisfy the second service connection requirement without further proof.",LegalRuleSentence
"Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 236.",CitationSentence
"If a veteran is presumed sound at service entrance, a disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service if the Secretary is unable to rebut the presumption.",LegalRuleSentence
"Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 53.",CitationSentence
"In this case, the Veteran is entitled to the presumption of soundness because a psychiatric condition was not ""noted"" an service entrance.",FindingSentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111; Horn, 25 Vet. App. 231.",CitationSentence
There is not clear and unmistakable evidence establishing the preexistence of a psychiatric condition.,FindingSentence
"First, there is no contemporaneous evidence prior to service.",ReasoningSentence
"Second, there is only circumstantial evidence indicating a preexisting psychiatric condition.",ReasoningSentence
"For instance, the diagnosis of ""PTSD features"" made at VA in June 2011 includes a parenthetical indicating ""(Childhood and MST)"".",EvidenceSentence
This would indicate that the Veteran's pre-service trauma contributed to the onset of psychiatric condition.,ReasoningSentence
"Moreover, a VA examiner reviewed the matter in July 2010 and again in September 2011.",EvidenceSentence
"This VA examiner marked the box in the Disabilities Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) stating that ""The claimed condition . . . clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service[.]""",EvidenceSentence
"In the Rationale section of the report, the VA examiner restated this opinion: The [V]eteran's (PTSD . . . ) which existed prior to service. . . .",EvidenceSentence
These types of definitive statements could support a finding that the condition preexisted service.,ReasoningSentence
"However, the VA examiner's September 2011 opinion is quite equivocal when read in its entirety.",ReasoningSentence
"First, the VA examiner started off by reiterating prior evidence, which he found to undermine the Veteran's credibility as a historian (relating the fact of preexisting trauma).",EvidenceSentence
"Then, the examiner declared that ""[a] mental disorder may have pre-existed military service."" (Emphasis added.)",EvidenceSentence
"Such an equivocal medical opinion, especially where it is based on the VA examiner's own assessment that the factual predicate was unreliable, does not meet VA's clear and unmistakable burden of proof.",ReasoningSentence
"See Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) (citing Harris, v. West, 11 Vet. App. 456, 462 (1998)); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).",CitationSentence
There is otherwise no clear and unmistakable evidence establishing a preexisting traumatic injury.,ReasoningSentence
"There is also no clear and unmistakable evidence establishing that his psychiatric condition, if preexisting, was not aggravated during service.",FindingSentence
"Again here, the September 2011 VA examiner marked the box in the DBQ indicating that the condition ""was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated"" by service.",EvidenceSentence
"In his own words, the examiner restated this opinion as follows: ""The [V]eteran's (PTSD . . .) . . . was NOT aggravated beyond natural progression by the sexual assault and rape in service.""",EvidenceSentence
(Emphasis in original.),Sentence
"The Board notes, as an initial matter, that this is a compound conclusion.",ReasoningSentence
"It could mean either (a) there was no aggravation by service and, therefore, no natural progression, or (b) that there was aggravation by service, but not one beyond the natural progression.",ReasoningSentence
"In either event, the VA went on to make remarks which undermine the conclusiveness of his opinion.",ReasoningSentence
"For instance, under bullet point number 4, he indicated that ""[s]ubstance abuse may have been [an] aggravating factor.""",EvidenceSentence
"When read most favorably for the Veteran, the examiner's statement tends to suggest that the examiner did find a degree of aggravation during service.",ReasoningSentence
"Also notable, the VA examiner stated in bullet number 5 that ""[o]ther service record evidence tends to contraindicate a severe impairment at that time.""",EvidenceSentence
"(The examiner had already stated his opinion that the Veteran ""may have . . . already experience severe childhood"" trauma.)",EvidenceSentence
This might indicate that the VA examiner found the preexisting diagnosis to have lessened in severity during service.,ReasoningSentence
"However, the examiner's use of the qualifiers ""tends"" and ""contraindicate"" suggest that this conclusion was not undebatable.",ReasoningSentence
"All of this evidence, including the VA examiner's conclusions, greatly increases the likelihood that a preexisting psychiatric condition was not aggravated by service.",ReasoningSentence
"However, this evidence does not make it clear and unmistakable.",ReasoningSentence
"Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not rebutted.",FindingSentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111; Horn, 25 Vet. App. 231.",CitationSentence
"Because the Veteran is presumed sound at service entrance, and because the presumption of soundness is not rebutted, the psychiatric condition that manifested in service is deemed service-incurred.",FindingSentence
"Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 53.",CitationSentence
3. Nexus,Sentence
"In light of the above two findings, the central question remaining in this case is whether the Veteran's current psychiatric condition is the same as that which was first manifested during service.",Sentence
"Even if an injury or disease is deemed to have been incurred in service pursuant to application of the presumption of soundness (or to have been found to have been actually incurred in service), a veteran must nonetheless establish that a current disability is related to the in-service injury or disease.",LegalRuleSentence
"Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 53-54 (citing Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009)(""The presumption of soundness . . . does not relieve the veteran of the obligation to show the presence of a current disability and to demonstrate a nexus between that disability and the in-service injury or disease or aggravation thereof."")).",CitationSentence
"Stated differently, the evidence must show that a disease or injury, if not noted upon entry to service, manifested during or was incurred in service.",LegalRuleSentence
The presumption of soundness is not for application without a predicate finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service.,LegalRuleSentence
Id. at 52.,CitationSentence
"Consequently, there must be evidence that the disease or injury (not noted upon entry to service) manifested or was incurred in service.",LegalRuleSentence
Id.,CitationSentence
"On this question in the present case, the July 2010 VA examiner found that the depression during service was not ""an early manifestation of his currently diagnosed schizoaffective disorder.""",EvidenceSentence
"However, the VA examiner based this conclusion on a finding that the Veteran had ""already experienced severe childhood"" stressors and ""was already manifesting alcohol dependence prior to the service and while in the service.""",EvidenceSentence
"The VA examiner found that this alcohol dependence ""could have just as likely been a contributing if not causative factor to any depressive or mental disorders at that time.""",EvidenceSentence
(The same VA examiner offered similar reasoning in the September 2011 examination report.),EvidenceSentence
It is implicit in the VA examiner's rationale that the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology during service was a continuation of a preexisting mental health condition.,ReasoningSentence
"Otherwise, the rationale offered cannot be reconciled with the opinion given.",ReasoningSentence
"Thus, the VA examiner's opinion must be interpreted to mean that the in-service depression was a manifestation of the preexisting condition.",ReasoningSentence
"By operation of the presumption of soundness, as explained herein above, the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms, even if actually preexisting service, must be deemed to have been service-incurred.",FindingSentence
"See Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 53-54.",CitationSentence
"Therefore, this VA examiner's opinion is essentially positive nexus evidence.",ReasoningSentence
There otherwise appears to be no material dispute that the Veteran's current psychiatric condition is a continuation of the symptoms deemed to have first manifested during service.,ReasoningSentence
"Accordingly, the evidence is in relative equipoise in making it likely that the Veteran's current mental health condition manifested during or was incurred in service.",FindingSentence
"See Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 52.",CitationSentence
"For these reasons, after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidentiary record is in relative equipoise as to all material elements of the claim.",FindingSentence
"Therefore, service connection is warranted for a psychiatric disability, variously diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and PTSD, and the claim must be granted.",FindingSentence
"Because the benefits being sought on appeal are granted in full, the Board finds that any errors in VA's duties to notify and assist are harmless and will not be discussed.",Sentence
"See 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.102, 3.103, 3.159 (2013).",CitationSentence

"Because the entrance examination reflected only a history of nervous trouble, and the Veteran's psychiatric system was clinically evaluated as normal, the Board finds that a psychiatric disorder was not noted at entry into service.",FindingSentence

38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303.,CitationSentence
Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.,LegalRuleSentence
"Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).",CitationSentence

Jurisdiction over the present appeal was first conferred to the Board in June 2009.,Sentence
"Service connection may also be established under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b), where a condition in service is noted but is not, in fact, chronic, or where a diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.",LegalRuleSentence
The continuity of symptomatology provision of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(b) has been interpreted as an alternative to service connection only for the specific chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.309(a).,LegalRuleSentence
"See Walker v. Shinseki, 718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).",CitationSentence

Acquired Psychiatric Disorders,Sentence
The Veteran contends that he was traumatized by active duty.,EvidenceSentence
"In addition, he asserts that he suffers from PTSD as a result of seeing fellow sailors commit suicide.",EvidenceSentence
"STRs show that at his August 1990 intake examination, he indicated that he had depression or excessive worry.",EvidenceSentence
He clarified this by reporting that he worried occasionally over situation stress.,EvidenceSentence
He had a normal psychiatric examination and no psychiatric diagnosis was noted.,EvidenceSentence
"As such, the presumption of soundness attaches to the Veteran's case.",FindingSentence
"However, because, as will be discussed, the evidence shows that an anxiety disorder did not manifest in service, there is no need to discuss the presumption of soundness.",FindingSentence
"See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012) (holding that the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury manifests in service which was not noted on entry, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service).",CitationSentence

"In October 1990, September 1991, and August 1992, the Veteran denied having any nervousness.",EvidenceSentence
"At his October 1992 separation examination, he denied having any depression or excessive worry or nervous trouble of any sort.",EvidenceSentence
He had a normal psychiatric examination.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran's STRs contain no evidence of any psychiatric complaints during his active service and only contain that single report of occasional worry over situation stress at his intake examination.,EvidenceSentence
The Veteran's military personnel records show he was assigned to the U.S.S. Enterprise from January 1991 to October 1992.,EvidenceSentence
"However, the command history for the U.S.S. Enterprise shows that it arrived at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company to undergo repairs in October 1990.",EvidenceSentence
The record contains no evidence that the U.S.S. Enterprise was ever deployed during the Veteran's active service.,EvidenceSentence
VA attempted to verify the reported PTSD stressor.,EvidenceSentence
"In June 2007, the Joint Serviced Records Research Center (JSRRC) reported that the information provided was insufficient to allow for meaningful research of the alleged events.",EvidenceSentence
"In April 2011, VA determined that the information required to corroborate the stressful events described by the Veteran was insufficient and that all procedures to obtain information from the Veteran were properly followed.",EvidenceSentence
VA concluded that the stressor could not be conceded.,EvidenceSentence
"The record does not contain any psychiatric complaints, treatment, or diagnosis until over a decade after his separation from service.",EvidenceSentence
"In August 2004, the Veteran started receiving treatment for his substance abuse disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"Furthermore, he denied having any symptoms of depression, anxiety, or psychosis.",EvidenceSentence
"In April 2007, he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"His treatment records note that he had a positive PTSD screen in August 2007; however, there is no accompanying treatment record documenting any information regarding this positive screen.",EvidenceSentence
"In October 2007, he was diagnosed with personality disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"In January 2009, he was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"In October 2010, the Veteran was administered another PTSD screen.",EvidenceSentence
"He was also administered the Morel Emotional Number Test for PTSD, which reflected an invalid performance pattern suggesting his positive PTSD responses be cautiously interpreted.",EvidenceSentence
The physician determined that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
"In March 2014, the Veteran reported that he had bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and PTSD, which the physician noted had never been documented or formally diagnosed.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2014.,EvidenceSentence
"The examination consisted of a review of the Veteran's claims file, an interview of the Veteran, and a mental status examination of the Veteran.",EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran confirmed that he was stationed on the U.S.S. Enterprise while it was at the Newport News Shipyard, but that he was deployed to Hong Kong, Singapore, and San Francisco for two and a half weeks.",EvidenceSentence
He also reported two sailors had hanged themselves.,EvidenceSentence
"He reported that at his intake examination, while he had indicated that he had depression or excessive worry, he explained that he was worried about getting killed in service.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD as he did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran did not report a traumatic stressor that would support a diagnosis of PTSD and had never been diagnosed with PTSD despite being assessed by a number of different health care providers.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder as he did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria for bipolar disorder or any kind.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the diagnosis of bipolar contained in his medical records should be considered a misdiagnosis as the provider appeared to have not been familiar with the Veteran's treatment record.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner noted that the Veteran's past diagnosis was made, in part, due to the Veteran's reporting different symptoms to different providers.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of panic disorder as the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran's reported panic attacks were likely a side-effect of substances or the discontinuation of substances.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of adjustment disorder as the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of psychosis as he did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria for psychosis or psychotic disorder.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of depressive disorder as he did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran denied all nine criteria for depression.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran had some mild problems with anxiety that may warrant an Axis I diagnosis.,EvidenceSentence
"However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's anxiety disorder was not caused by, related to, or the result of his naval service.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran's STRs were silent for complaints of anxiety or any mental health treatment.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner reported that the Veteran met the full DSM-V criteria for antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.,EvidenceSentence
"However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's personality disorder was not caused by, the result of, or related to his naval service.",EvidenceSentence
"In an April 2015 addendum opinion, the June 2014 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current ""extremely mild"" symptoms of anxiety were clearly and unmistakably not caused by or aggravated by service.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that that there was no objective way to determine whether or not the Veteran had anxiety prior to service.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner reported that she could not state, without resorting to mere speculation, that the Veteran was actually diagnosed with anxiety disorder in childhood.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran was not diagnosed with any anxiety disorder while on active duty.,EvidenceSentence
"In addition, the examiner noted that the Veteran's medical record dating back to 2004 repeatedly documented he did not have mental health symptoms other than substance abuse.",EvidenceSentence
"Based upon the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence fails to support a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period",FindingSentence

Service connection for PTSD is denied.,FindingSentence
"The Veteran's representative argued in the February 2016 brief that the Veteran was unaware of terminology, and simply did not understand ""anxiety"" and ""depression"" at the age of 18 and 19.",Sentence
"In a Report of Medical History, dated August 2, 1990, the Veteran marked ""Yes"" for depression; the doctor's explanation was ""situational stress.",EvidenceSentence

"The representative has asserted that these symptoms constituted the onset of, or manifestations of, the Veteran's currently diagnosed anxiety disorder.",Sentence
The Board appreciates the representative's thorough review of the file and zealous representation.,Sentence
"However, while the representative pointed out several symptoms that the representative felt might be indicative of the onset of an anxiety disorder, the fact remains that there is no medical evidence of record endorsing the representative's suggestions.",ReasoningSentence
This is highly relevant in that the representative has not been shown to have the medical training or expertise to link in-service symptoms to a current psychiatric diagnosis.,ReasoningSentence
"See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).",CitationSentence
"Moreover, VA has obtained a highly detailed and thorough medical opinion explaining specifically why the Veteran's anxiety disorder neither began during nor was otherwise caused by his military service.",ReasoningSentence
"In providing that opinion, the examiner noted that she had conducted an approximate 20 hour review of the Veteran's claims file.",EvidenceSentence
"As such, the representative's statement does not establish service connection and does not trigger the duty to assist.",ReasoningSentence
"As discussed, the medical evidence is squarely against the suggestions that the Veteran's anxiety disorder had its onset in service or within a year of service discharge or is otherwise etiologically related to service.",ReasoningSentence
"The record contains no evidence of any mental health symptoms in service, at discharge, and after his separation from service until he started treating for substance abuse in 2004 (as explained by the VA examiner following an extensive claims file review).",ReasoningSentence
There is also no competent medical opinion of record which relates the Veteran's anxiety disorder to his service.,ReasoningSentence
"To the contrary, as stated, the VA examiner clearly indicated that the Veteran only had extremely mild symptoms of anxiety.",EvidenceSentence
"Furthermore, the examiner reported that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria for bipolar disorder, panic disorder, adjustment disorder, or psychotic disorder.",EvidenceSentence
"Finally, the VA examiner opined that there was no relationship between the Veteran's anxiety disorder and his active service as the Veteran's current very mild anxiety symptoms were most likely related to his current life difficulties.",EvidenceSentence
"While the Veteran was diagnosed with personality disorder, service connection may not be awarded for personality disorders.",LegalRuleSentence
See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.303(c).,CitationSentence
"As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report what comes to him through his senses, but he lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the etiology of an anxiety disorder.",ReasoningSentence

"The evidence used to support the story can be medical records, police records, statements from the Veteran's family and friends, and changes in behavior, to include substance abuse, a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment, and unexplained changes in social behavior.",ReasoningSentence
The Veteran's post-service medical records do not mention the in-service personal assault until his June 2010 VA initial mental health assessment.,EvidenceSentence
"At that assessment, the Veteran indicated that he attempted suicide by overdosing on Thorazine in 1968, probably on the anniversary of the sexual assault.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran further stated that he has never been the same since that incident.,EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, the Veteran stated that he has had sleep problems and rage since the personal assault in 1963.",EvidenceSentence
"Moreover, the Veteran indicated that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and discharged from the Army.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran's wife also stated that he has never really been able to sleep during the 30 years that she has known him and that his anger and rage used to be unbelievable until he quit drinking.,EvidenceSentence
"Importantly, the Veteran stated that the sexual assault was performed by a group of special forces members and that he never reported it.",EvidenceSentence

"However, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) shows no indication that the personal assault occurred.",EvidenceSentence
"In the Veteran's May 1961 entrance examination, the Veteran denied a history of relevant symptoms, including depression or excessive worry, nervous trouble of any sort, and treatment for a mental condition.",EvidenceSentence

The Veteran is certainly competent to report as to his observable symptoms and experiences.,ReasoningSentence

The Veteran's DD-214 also contains a notation that the Veteran had 3 days lost in November of 1962.,EvidenceSentence
"However, there is no indication that the Veteran went AWOL as a result of the asserted personal assault that could have happened 5 months prior, depending on what identified timeframe is relied on as the date of the assault.",ReasoningSentence
"Further, the record also shows that the Veteran left the Special Forces.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran's wife has indicated that this occurred because of the physical assault.,EvidenceSentence
See July 2011 correspondence.,CitationSentence
"However, the Veteran told the May 2012 VA examiner that he was getting increasingly scared about parachuting and did not enjoy it.",EvidenceSentence
He also stated that he hurt his ankle twice while in jump school and did not want to continue.,EvidenceSentence
"On review of the medical records, the Board finds that the May 2012 VA examination is the most probative medical evidence of record, as to the question of whether the Veteran's claimed personal assault stressor actually occurred.",ReasoningSentence
The VA examiner opined that there is no evidence in his military record of markers related to MST.,EvidenceSentence
"The examiner stated that the Veteran sought treatment for a sprained ankle twice, sore throat, and cough consistently between 1961-1964 with no apparent increase in medical services after the asserted assault in 1962.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner further stated that the Veteran reports a history of alcohol problems beginning prior to the assault with no significant change in pattern after 1962.,EvidenceSentence

"The Veteran reported significant childhood physical, emotional and sexual molestation.",EvidenceSentence
He did not receive consistent treatment for his pre-service trauma and it was not clear to the examiner whether those issues had resolved.,EvidenceSentence

The Veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of his combat experiences as an underwater demolition team combat swimmer.,EvidenceSentence
"As noted above, in order for the Veteran to be entitled to service connection for PTSD, the medical evidence must show a diagnosis of PTSD linked to an in-service stressor.",ReasoningSentence
"With respect the Veteran's claimed stressors, the record shows that he engaged in combat with the enemy as an underwater demolition team member; in June 1945, he was involved in a diving operation during which bombs exploded nearby, he suffered concussion injury, and one of his fellow teammates died.",EvidenceSentence
"Service personnel records and DD 214s reflect that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was as an underwater demolition team combat swimmer from December 1949 to March 1955, a diver from March 1955 to December 1960, and a diver foreman from December 1960 to May 1964 and that he received various decorations, including Purple Heart and Bronze Start Medal with ""V"" device, which is indicative of combat participation.",EvidenceSentence
"Service treatment records show that on June 8, 1945, the Veteran was doing a swimming reconnaissance off Ramsey Point, Labuan Island, North Borneo, when bombs dropped from Liberators fell and exploded nearby.",EvidenceSentence
He suffered from mild shock and pain in the abdomen.,EvidenceSentence
The diagnosis was blast concussion water.,EvidenceSentence
"As such, the Board finds the Veteran's alleged combat stressors as consistent with his verified military occupation specialty as a Navy diver and service department records.",FindingSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f).,CitationSentence
"In January 2012, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination.",EvidenceSentence
The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner noted that the Veteran had severe dementia and was unable to discuss the underwater incident in June 1945 and all details were provided by his wife.,EvidenceSentence
The examiner stated that there was insufficient evidence to diagnose PTSD due to no history of treatment or evidence of PTSD symptoms prior to dementia onset and the Veteran's inability to meaningfully participate in a clinical interview.,EvidenceSentence
"In contrast, a private psychiatrist, Dr. M.B., opined in May 2013 that it is much more likely than not that the alleged stressor events contributed directly to the occurrence of severe, chronic, delayed onset posttraumatic stress disorder in the Veteran's case.",EvidenceSentence
"In reaching this conclusion, Dr. B. initially noted that the Veteran demonstrated well the required clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis severe PTSD, chronic, delayed onset, in accordance with the DSM-IV, since 2007 to the present, based on his investigations and interviews, including family, fellow veteran combat swimmers, other foreign war veterans, health care team and other Navy diving medicine experts.",EvidenceSentence
"Dr. B. indicated that he was a national and miliary expert in the combined field of the psychiatry of military diving and the effect of disasters, trauma, and PTSD among Navy divers, and provided his insight as follows:",EvidenceSentence
"Navy diving training always forges extreme mental physical and emotional ""toughness,"" with compartmentalization of negative emotions such as fear anxiety and grief which could get in the way of a mission.",EvidenceSentence
This ingrained compartmentalization usually persists for years as a part of the diver's personality long after a Navy diving career is completed. . . .,EvidenceSentence
"Diver's psychological defenses are adaptively hardened from years of unexpected exposures to traumatic experiences; however, many years later, they can develop PTSD replaying and reliving in dramatic fashion those situations which caused physical injury intense fear and anxiety of being ambushed or coming under fire and grief over seeing and swimming among bodies and body parts of fellow divers.",EvidenceSentence
This exactly describes what happened in [the Veteran's] life.,EvidenceSentence
He experienced combat and came under attack repeatedly; this is documented in citations he received which are a matter of record in previous documents submitted on behalf of his appeals to the Department of Veterans Affairs.,EvidenceSentence
"Information about one of his serious wounds during combat, a traumatic brain injury, is also part of this file.",EvidenceSentence
"It was only until his brain expected aging in later life caused both structural brain decline as well as the decline of those ingrained psychological defenses; in 2007, this led to the beginning of a flooding of emotional responses to past wartime horrors.",EvidenceSentence
He has replayed these situations over and over in public and in front of his health care providers at the Perry Point Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) as well as in the presence of his family members at home and at reunions of wartime combat and special warfare swimmers.,EvidenceSentence
Email correspondence dated April 2013 between Dr. B and another physician reflects that they agreed that PTSD best described the Veteran's behavior which deluded him into thinking that the metal hair clamps of a female in the hospital hallway were improvised explosive devices which must be disarmed and made safe and he must protect the hospital and those in it from injury by enemy forces landing on the river bank and attacking.,EvidenceSentence
"Dr. B. also reviewed the January 2012 VA examination report and pointed out that this determination was based upon the Veteran's lack of cooperation during one brief interview of several questions, to which he responded ""Ask my wife,"" but his wife was not allowed to provide information at this examination.",EvidenceSentence
"It was further noted that the Veteran's brief singular responses were actually direct manifestations of PTSD; avoidance of stimuli (conversation) that recall/relive the traumatic events; suspicious ness of a strange individual; and misperception that he was being interrogated by ""an enemy soldier"" in a POW situation and not cooperating to provide information which could betray his men and cause them harm and torture.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, there is evidence of record that indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his alleged combat stressors in service.",FindingSentence
"Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his claimed in-service combat stressors.",FindingSentence

FINDINGS OF FACT,Sentence
"1. It is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has PTSD resulting from the death of his brother, which was an event that occurred during the Veteran's active military service.",FindingSentence
"2. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the evidence shows that his diagnosed MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS had their onset during his active military service.",FindingSentence
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS,Sentence
"The Veteran seeks service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, and depression (diagnosed at various times as MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS).",Sentence
The Veteran's younger brother died in a car accident while the Veteran was serving on active duty.,EvidenceSentence
"He reports that after the death of his brother, he began experiencing nightmares, depression, social isolation and other psychiatric symptoms.",EvidenceSentence
He reports that he turned to God and religion in an attempt to deal with his pain.,EvidenceSentence
His service records show that he applied for and was granted a discharge from the Army as a conscientious objector.,EvidenceSentence
"The Veteran reports that his psychiatric symptoms not only persisted, but worsened after his separation from service, leading to multiple suicide attempts starting in 1976.",EvidenceSentence
"His medical records show that he has been treated for psychiatric symptoms since 1984, and has been hospitalized on several occasions as a result of suicide attempts.",EvidenceSentence
He asserts that his continuing symptoms are related to the death of his brother during service.,EvidenceSentence
"The Board finds that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD, MDD, dysthymia and depression NOS.",FindingSentence
"Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.",LegalRuleSentence

"See 80 Fed. Reg. 14308 (March 19, 2015).",CitationSentence
"As an initial matter, the Board notes that the presumption of soundness applies in this matter.",FindingSentence

"Although there is evidence of record that the Veteran experienced some psychiatric symptoms prior to service, his May 1974 entrance examination revealed no psychiatric disorder.",ReasoningSentence
"Additionally, even though an October 2010 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD and depression had their onset prior to service, the January 2013 VA examiner opined that it was not undebatable that the Veteran's PTSD and depression pre-existed service.",ReasoningSentence
"Thus, the Board finds that presumption of soundness applies in this matter and has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence.",FindingSentence
The issue in this case is whether the Veteran's PTSD and/or depression had an onset in service or is due to an event occurring in service.,Sentence
The Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted because the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD linked to the death of his brother during service.,FindingSentence
"There is no dispute that the Veteran's brother died in October 1974, while the Veteran was serving on active duty.",ReasoningSentence
The issue for adjudication is whether he has a diagnosis of PTSD that is linked to his brother's death.,Sentence
The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise.,FindingSentence
"The Veteran submitted private medical opinions in September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 in which clinical psychologist J. Smith opined that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and that the diagnosis of PTSD is linked to the death of his brother.",EvidenceSentence
"See September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 Private Medical Opinions of J. Smith, Ph.D.",CitationSentence
The Veteran's VA medical records also show a diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.,EvidenceSentence
The Board finds this evidence sufficient to establish a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with the applicable regulations.,FindingSentence
"See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).",CitationSentence
The Board notes that the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners both opined that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under either the DSM IV or the DSM 5 because his stressor fails to meet Criterion A necessary for PTSD diagnosis.,EvidenceSentence
The November 2013 VA examiner also opined that the Veteran denied current significant re-experiencing (Criterion B) symptoms and further denied significant avoidance and impairment in functioning symptoms regarding his reported stressor.,EvidenceSentence
"However, in his April 2014 addendum opinion, Dr. Smith addressed these criteria, stating that the death of the Veteran's brother did meet Criterion A because the Veteran was confronted with the death of his brother and his response to this news was one of horror and helplessness.",EvidenceSentence
"Dr. Smith further noted that the diagnosis of PTSD reflects continuing symptoms of poor sleep, marked and continuing anxiety and depression, continued intrusion of ""triggering"" experiences and events such as contact with his family or hearing reports on the news of young people dying in a hit and run situation, and avoidance of the area of where his brother died.",EvidenceSentence
"The October 2010 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran reported experiencing intrusive thoughts related to his brother on a weekly basis, and avoidance of therapy because the he ""doesn't like to bring up the past.""",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise on the issue of whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD relating to his brother's death.",FindingSentence
38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b).,CitationSentence
"Consequently, service connection for PTSD is warranted.",FindingSentence
"See 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.303, 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).",CitationSentence
The Board also finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's depression is related to the death of his younger brother.,FindingSentence
"The Veteran reported experiencing psychiatric symptoms, including depression, social isolation and nightmares, in service and since his discharge from service.",EvidenceSentence
"He stated that he experienced a ""radical change,"" and tried turning to religion.",EvidenceSentence
See October 2007 Hearing Tr. at 2.,CitationSentence
"The Veteran also reported attempting suicide within one year after his separation from service, and attempting suicide multiple times before seeking treatment in 1984.",EvidenceSentence
The Veteran is competent to offer testimony regarding the symptoms he experienced.,ReasoningSentence
"See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).",CitationSentence
The Board observes that there is evidence of record that contradicts the Veteran's assertion that his symptoms started in service and have been recurrent since that time.,ReasoningSentence
"Most notably, he was examined multiple times in service and found to have no psychiatric disorder.",EvidenceSentence
See February 1975 Report of Mental Status Evaluation; see also May 1975 Mental Hygiene Consultation Report.,CitationSentence
"However, the Veteran reported that his psychiatric examination was very brief.",EvidenceSentence
"Additionally, Dr. Smith opined that the examination ""appeared to be simply designed to meet an administrative requirement and did not constitute a full psychiatric examination"" because the examination report showed no evidence that the examiner explored the Veteran's reaction to his brother's death.",EvidenceSentence
See April 2014 Addendum Private Medical Opinion of J. Smith.,CitationSentence
"Thus, the Board does not find the lack of a psychiatric diagnosis on examination during service to be determinative.",ReasoningSentence
"After weighing the evidence and affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, the Board finds his reports regarding the onset and continuation of his depressive symptoms to be credible.",ReasoningSentence
"As noted by the March 2016, the Veteran's reports of ongoing psychiatric symptoms have been consistent.",ReasoningSentence
"In August 1989, when discussing the history of his depression, he stated that his brother's death had been very traumatic for him.",EvidenceSentence
See August 1989 VA Medical Record.,CitationSentence
"At a February 2006 group therapy session, he talked about how his brother's death was ""still bothering him.""",EvidenceSentence
See February 2006 VA Medical Record.,CitationSentence
"During an April 2006 examination performed in connection with his Social Security disability claim, he stated that he thought his psychological symptoms were due, at least in part, to the death of his brother.",EvidenceSentence
See April 2006 Psychological Examination Report.,CitationSentence
"The Board notes that he reported having ""problems"" beginning in 1984, but that during the same time frame he also reported first seeking treatment in 1984 and first experiencing an impact in his ability to work in 1984.",EvidenceSentence
"Thus, it appears that he did not mean that his symptoms started at that time, but that he became significantly impaired in 1984.",ReasoningSentence
"At his October 2007 hearing, he again reported having an onset of depressive symptoms in service.",EvidenceSentence
See October 2007 Hearing Tr. at 2-4.,CitationSentence
"During the October 2010 VA examination, he reported ""increased"" depression after the loss of his brother.",EvidenceSentence
"He also reported that he attempted suicide in the early 1970s after service, and that his suicide attempts have been primarily by overdose, carbon monoxide poisoning and a few times by placing a gun to his head without pulling the trigger.",EvidenceSentence
"This report is consistent with his statements made during his interview with Dr. Smith (as reported in the September 2012 independent evaluation report), the statements captured in his February 2013 affidavit, and the statements made during the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examinations.",ReasoningSentence
"In light of the consistencies in the Veteran's reports concerning the onset and continuity of his symptoms, the Board finds his testimony credible.",ReasoningSentence
"Because the Board finds the Veteran's reports of his recurrent psychiatric symptoms to be credible, it affords more probative value to the opinions of the Dr. Smith, and less probative value to the opinions of the VA examiners.",ReasoningSentence
The November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's depression was not related to his brother's death because there were no contemporaneous medical records confirming his reports of depressive symptoms prior to 1984.,EvidenceSentence
The November 2013 VA examiner also reasoned that there were no mention of mental health issues in the letters the Veteran submitted from friends and family in support of his discharge from service.,EvidenceSentence
"In general, a VA examiner may not rely on the absence of evidence as negative evidence, particularly where there is no indication that the fact should have been recorded.",LegalRuleSentence
"See, e.g., Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272-75 (2015); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 223-24 (2011).",CitationSentence
"In this case, as noted by Dr. Smith, ""absence of a formal record of care in no way proves that symptoms were not present, nor does it suggest that care was not needed- only that formal care had not as yet been sought.""",ReasoningSentence
April 2014 Private Addendum Opinion of J. Smith.,CitationSentence
"Additionally, there is no reason for the Board to determine that there would be reports of psychiatric symptoms contained in the letters provided by the Veteran's friends and family in support of his request for discharge from service based on his religious beliefs.",ReasoningSentence
"The evidence of record shows that the purpose of those letters was to corroborate the Veteran's assertion that his change in religious viewed prevented him from serving on active duty; consequently, it is not expected that any discussion of depressive symptoms would be included in such letters.",ReasoningSentence
"For these reasons, the Board affords the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners' negative nexus opinions little probative value.",ReasoningSentence
"As all three elements necessary to establish service connection have been met, service connection for depression (diagnosed as MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS) is warranted.",FindingSentence
